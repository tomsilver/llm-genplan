Implement the strategy as a Python function.

The code should should be of the form

    def get_plan(objects, init, goal):
        # Your code here
        return plan

where
    - `objects` is a set of objects (string names)
    - `init` is a set of ground atoms represented as tuples of predicate
        names and arguments (e.g., ('predicate-foo', 'object-bar', ...))
    - `goal` is also a set of ground atoms represented in the same way
    - `plan` is a list of actions, where each action is represented as a
        tuple of operator name and arguments (e.g., ('operator-baz',
        'object-qux', ...)).
