The movie-strips domain is a planning problem that focuses on preparing for a movie night. The main tasks involve rewinding the movie, resetting the movie counter, and gathering various types of food and snacks. The domain defines various predicates such as movie-rewound, counter-at-two-hours, counter-at-zero, and the availability of different snacks like chips, dip, pop, cheese, and crackers. The domain also specifies actions for rewinding the movie (in two different scenarios: counter at two hours and counter at other than two hours), resetting the counter, and getting the various snacks. The example problems provided include different sets of objects and initial conditions to achieve the goal of having a rewound movie, zeroed counter, and all the snacks gathered for the movie night.
