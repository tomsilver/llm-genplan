The Miconic domain represents a simplified elevator system. In this domain, there are passengers and floors as objects. Each passenger has an origin floor and a destination floor. The elevator can be at a specific floor at any given time, and passengers can be either on board or not on board. Passengers can also be either served (arrived at their destination) or not served.

There are four main actions in this domain:

    Board - A passenger boards the elevator when it is at their origin floor.
    Depart - A passenger departs the elevator when it is at their destination floor.
    Up - The elevator moves up to a floor above its current position.
    Down - The elevator moves down to a floor below its current position.

The goal of the problem instances in this domain is to serve all passengers by transporting them from their origin floors to their destination floors.
