A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is the "Sweep" strategy. Here's how it works:

    Start at the lowest floor (e.g., floor 0).
    Move the elevator upwards, stopping at each floor.
    At each floor, board any passengers whose origin floor is the current floor.
    Continue moving upwards until the elevator reaches the highest floor.
    Move the elevator downwards, stopping at each floor.
    At each floor, let passengers depart if their destination floor is the current floor, and board any passengers whose origin floor is the current floor.
    Continue moving downwards until the elevator reaches the lowest floor.
    Repeat steps 2-7 until all passengers have been served.

This strategy ensures that all passengers are picked up from their origin floors and dropped off at their destination floors without the need for any search algorithm. It may not be the most efficient strategy in terms of the total number of moves, but it guarantees a solution to the problem.
