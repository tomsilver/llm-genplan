The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is called the "Sweep" strategy. In this strategy, the elevator starts from the lowest floor and moves upward to the highest floor, allowing passengers to board and depart at their respective floors. Once the elevator reaches the top floor, it reverses direction and moves downward to the lowest floor, again allowing passengers to board and depart as necessary. This process continues until all passengers have reached their destinations.

This strategy guarantees that all passengers will eventually be served, as the elevator covers all floors in both directions. However, it may not always be the most efficient solution in terms of the total number of moves or time taken.
