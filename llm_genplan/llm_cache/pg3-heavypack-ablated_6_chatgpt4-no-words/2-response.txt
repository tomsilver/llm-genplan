The simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to apply the action operators sequentially, following these steps:

1. Apply operator0 to the object that initially satisfies predicate6 and predicate0. This will cause predicate4 and predicate2 to become true for that object, and predicate6 to become false.

2. For each remaining object that satisfies predicate6, apply operator1 with the previously processed object as ?v0 and the current object as ?v4. This will make predicate4 and predicate2 true for the current object, negate predicate2 for the previously processed object, and negate predicate6 for the current object. 

3. Repeat step 2 until all objects have predicate4 as true.

This strategy works because operator0 can only be applied when predicate0 is true, and it can only be applied once. After applying operator0, predicate0 will be false, and only operator1 can be applied. By applying operator1 sequentially as described, we ensure that predicate4 becomes true for all objects, which is the goal for all problems in this domain.
