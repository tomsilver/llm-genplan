In this domain, a simple strategy to solve all problems without using search is to follow the trails. The trails are a sequence of "ontrail" predicates that connect adjacent locations. Since these trails are pre-defined and connect two adjacent locations without requiring any complex pathfinding, you can use the "walk" and "climb" actions to follow the trails and reach the goal location.

To implement this strategy, you can iteratively perform the following steps:

Identify the current location (the one with the "at" predicate).
Find the next location on the trail by checking the "ontrail" predicates that include the current location.
If the next location is a hill, use the "climb" action; otherwise, use the "walk" action.
Update the current location to the next location.
Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the goal location.
By following the trails, you can effectively solve all problems in this domain without requiring any search algorithms or heuristics.
