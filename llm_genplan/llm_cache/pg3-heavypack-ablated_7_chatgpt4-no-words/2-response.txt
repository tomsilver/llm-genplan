The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to apply operator0 and operator1 sequentially for each object in the problem. Since the goal is to have predicate4 true for all objects, you can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Apply operator0 to each object in the problem. This action will satisfy the precondition of predicate0 being true initially, and its effect will make predicate4 and predicate2 true with the object as their argument while negating predicate6 for that object. After applying operator0 for all objects, predicate0 will be false and all objects will have predicate4 and predicate2 true.

2. Now, apply operator1 for each pair of objects (?v0 and ?v4) where predicate1 is true in the initial state. By applying operator1, you'll maintain predicate4 being true for each object while updating predicate2 and predicate6 as required. Since the precondition of operator1 requires predicate4 and predicate2 to be true with ?v0 as their argument and predicate1 and predicate6 to be true with ?v0 and ?v4 as their arguments, respectively, applying operator1 will ensure that predicate4 remains true for all objects, satisfying the goal state.

By applying operator0 and operator1 in this manner, you can solve all problems in this domain without having to perform a search.
