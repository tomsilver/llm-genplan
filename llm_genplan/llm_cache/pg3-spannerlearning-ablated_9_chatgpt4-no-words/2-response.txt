A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a sequential approach that applies the action operators in the correct order. Since the goal of the problems is to make predicate6 true for all objects of type4, we can follow these steps:

1. First, apply 'operator0' to all objects of type3 and type6 that share a common object of type2. This will create connections between objects of type3 and type6 using predicate1.

2. Then, for each object of type4 with predicate3 true, find the corresponding objects of type3 and type6 connected through predicate1 and with predicate7 true. Apply 'operator1' to these objects. This will make predicate6 true for the object of type4, and predicate7 and predicate3 false for the corresponding objects of type6 and type4, respectively.

By following this strategy, we can achieve the goal state without the need for search, as we directly manipulate the connections and properties using the action operators in a systematic way.
