A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

1. Start at the home base (ishomebase location).
2. Pick up an unpacked newspaper (using the pick-up action).
3. Move to the next safe location that wants a newspaper (using the move action).
4. Deliver the newspaper to that location (using the deliver action), which satisfies the location.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all locations that want a newspaper have been satisfied.
6. Check if the goal state has been reached, i.e., all specified locations are satisfied.

This greedy strategy does not require any search, as it sequentially delivers newspapers to each location that wants one, ensuring that the delivery person always moves to a safe location and only carries one newspaper at a time.
