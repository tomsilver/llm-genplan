The Trap Newspapers domain involves delivering newspapers to different locations. The domain includes types for locations and papers, and predicates for tracking whether a location is the home base, whether a location wants a newspaper, whether a location has been satisfied, and whether a paper has been unpacked or is being carried. There are actions for picking up a paper, moving to a new location, and delivering a paper. Two example problems are given, where the goal is to satisfy the desires for newspapers at certain locations by delivering the appropriate papers.
