The simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a sequential approach. Perform the following steps:

1. Identify all objects of type2 for which predicate2 must be true as part of the goal state.
2. For each of these objects, find a corresponding object of type0 for which either predicate7 or predicate4 is true.
3. Apply the operator0 to each object pair (type2, type0) for which predicate7 is true, making predicate2 true for the corresponding type2 object.
4. Apply the operator1 to each object pair (type2, type0) for which predicate4 and predicate2 are true, making predicate8 true for the corresponding type2 object.
5. Check if the goal state is achieved, i.e., if predicate8 is true for all objects of type2.

Since the preconditions for the actions are relatively simple, and the actions can be applied in a specific order, this strategy eliminates the need for search, and problems can be solved in a straightforward manner.
