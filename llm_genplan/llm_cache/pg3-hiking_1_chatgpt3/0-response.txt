This domain represents a hiking scenario, where the objective is to traverse a landscape consisting of hills, water bodies, and trails connecting different locations. The domain includes two actions, "walk" and "climb," which allow the agent to move between adjacent locations on the trail or climb hills. The predicates include "at" to represent the current location of the agent, "iswater" to identify water bodies, "ishill" to identify hills, "adjacent" to denote neighboring locations, and "ontrail" to identify locations connected by a trail. The problem instances involve specifying the initial location of the agent, the location of hills and water bodies, and the goal location that the agent needs to reach by traversing the trail network.
