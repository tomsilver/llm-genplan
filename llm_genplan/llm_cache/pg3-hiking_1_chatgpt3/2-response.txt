The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always move to an adjacent location that is not a hill and not water until the goal location is reached. This strategy involves repeatedly applying the "walk" action to move along the trail until the agent reaches the goal location, without ever using the "climb" action to move to a hill or crossing water bodies. This strategy works because the problem instances are designed such that the goal location is always reachable from the initial location by traversing only the trail network, and the "walk" action can only be applied on the trail. Therefore, this simple strategy guarantees a solution for all instances in this domain, without requiring any search.
