The error message indicates that the precondition for the `sail` action is not satisfied. Specifically, the ferry's initial location is not specified in the initial state, so the precondition `(at-ferry ?from)` in the `sail` action is not satisfied when the initial location `None` is substituted for `?from`. 

To fix this, we need to add the initial location of the ferry to the initial state. We can do this by adding the ground atom `(at-ferry l7)` to the `:init` section of the problem definition. The updated problem definition would look like this:

```
(define (problem ferryprob (:domain ferry)
