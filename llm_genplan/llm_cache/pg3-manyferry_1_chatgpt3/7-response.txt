The given code is not present, but based on the error message, it seems that there is a string literal that is not properly terminated in the code at or before line 68. Here is an example of how the code should be fixed:

```
(define (problem ferryprob)
  (:domain ferry)
  (:objects
    c0
    c1
    c2
    c3
    c4
    l0

    l10
    l2
    l3
    ...
  )
  (:init
    (at c0 l1)
    (at c1 l4)
    (at c2 l1)
    (at c3 l7)
    (at c4 l7)

    (car c0)
    (car c1)
    (car c2)
    (car c3)
    (car c4)
    (empty-ferry)

    (location l1)
    (location l10)

    (not-eq l0 l6)
    (not-eq l0 l7)
    (not-eq l0 l8)
    (not-eq l0 l9)
    ...
