The ferry domain is a simple transportation problem where cars need to be transported across different locations using a ferry. The domain consists of several predicates including the car and location, and actions such as sail, board, and debark. The sail action moves the ferry from one location to another, the board action allows a car to board the ferry if it's in the same location, and the debark action allows a car to leave the ferry when it arrives at the destination. The problem involves specifying the initial location of the cars and the destination they need to reach, with the goal of moving all the cars to their desired locations.
