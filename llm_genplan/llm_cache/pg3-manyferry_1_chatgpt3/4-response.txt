The error message indicates that the precondition for the `sail` action is not satisfied. Specifically, the ferry's initial location is not specified in the initial state, so the precondition `(at-ferry ?from)` in the `sail` action is not satisfied when the initial location `None` is substituted for `?from`. 

To fix the code, we need to specify the initial location of the ferry in the initial state. For example, we could add the following line to the `(:init ...)` section:

```
(at-ferry l3)
```

This specifies that the ferry is initially located at `l3`, which satisfies the precondition for the `sail` action when `?from` is substituted with `l3`. With this change, the planner should be able to find a valid plan for the problem.
