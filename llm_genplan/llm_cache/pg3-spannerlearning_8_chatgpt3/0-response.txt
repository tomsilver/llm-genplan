The "spanner" domain is a simple planning domain that involves a man, nuts, and spanners. The goal is to tighten all the nuts in a specific location by using the available spanners carried by the man. The actions available are walking, picking up a spanner, and tightening a nut. The domain also includes predicates to indicate the current location of objects, whether the man is carrying a spanner, whether a spanner is usable, and whether a nut is tight or loose. There are two example problems provided, where the initial state specifies the location of the man, nuts, and spanners, and the goal is to tighten all nuts.
