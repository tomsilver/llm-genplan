A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to break the problem-solving process down into a series of smaller steps. You can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Identify the objects that need to be reconnected (the goal configuration) and find the initial configuration in the problem.

2. For each pair of objects that need to be reconnected:
   a. Check if the pair is already connected in the initial state. If yes, move on to the next pair.
   b. If not, find the current connection of the object in the initial state.

3. Iterate through the objects and perform the following operations:
   a. Use `operator1` to disconnect the object from its current connection (if required) and set predicate5.
   b. Use `operator2` to change the active object (predicate1) to the desired object, if it is not already active.
   c. Use `operator0` to connect the object to the desired object and unset predicate5.

4. Repeat step 3 until all the desired connections in the goal state are made.

This strategy takes advantage of the domain's structure and does not require searching through multiple possible actions. Instead, it systematically modifies the connections in the problem to match the desired goal configuration.
