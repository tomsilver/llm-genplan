The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is as follows:

1. Identify the current object with predicate1 (source object) and the target object where you want to apply predicate1 (goal object).

2. Check if the source object is already connected to a different object with predicate0. If so, use operator0 to disconnect the source object (by applying predicate3) and free the resource (by applying predicate5).

3. Connect the source object with the goal object using operator2. This will also consume the resource (removing predicate5) and create a connection between the source object and the goal object (applying predicate0).

4. If you need to move predicate1 to another object, use operator1 to transfer it from the current source object to the new goal object.

Repeat steps 2-4 until all goals are achieved. This strategy works because the operators have been designed in such a way that they only change the relationships between objects and the presence of predicate1, without introducing any additional complexity.
