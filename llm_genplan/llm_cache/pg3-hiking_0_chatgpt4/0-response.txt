The hiking domain consists of a grid of locations represented by loc objects. The domain defines two actions, walk and climb, which allow movement between locations. The walk action can be taken when the destination location is not a hill, and the climb action can be taken when the destination location is a hill. Both actions require the starting location to not be water. The locations are connected by predicates that represent adjacency and whether a location is water, a hill, or on a trail.

The example problems describe a specific grid of locations and their relationships. The objective of these problems is to move from a starting location to a goal location by following a trail and avoiding water while traversing hills using the walk and climb actions as appropriate.
