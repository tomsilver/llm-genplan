The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow the "clear and stack" method. This strategy involves these steps:

    Clear the table by unstacking all the blocks that are not already on the table.
    Place all the blocks on the table by picking them up and putting them down.
    Stack the blocks in the desired order according to the goal state.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

    Unstack all blocks:
    a. Identify any blocks that are not on the table and have another block on top of them.
    b. Unstack the top block using the unstack action, and then put it down on the table with the put-down action.
    c. Repeat this process for all blocks in the stack until only the bottom block remains.
    d. Repeat steps a-c for all other stacks of blocks.

    Place all blocks on the table:
    a. For any blocks that are not already on the table, pick them up using the pick-up action.
    b. Put the block down on the table using the put-down action.

    Stack the blocks in the desired order:
    a. Following the goal state's order, pick up the first block in the desired stack using the pick-up action.
    b. Stack the block on the next block in the desired order using the stack action.
    c. Repeat steps a and b for all the remaining blocks in the desired order.

By following this "clear and stack" strategy, the agent can solve any problem in the blocks domain without the need for search algorithms.
