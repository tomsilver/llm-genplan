The gripper-strips domain is a simple robotics domain where a robot named Robby has two grippers and can move in between different rooms. The robot can pick up and carry balls located in different rooms using its grippers and drop them off in other rooms. The domain involves the actions of moving, picking up a ball, and dropping a ball, with various preconditions and effects for each action. The goal of the domain is to move all the balls from one room to another using the robot's grippers. Two example problems are provided, one with four balls and one with six balls, both of which require Robby to move all the balls to a different room.
