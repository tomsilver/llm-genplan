The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pick-up paper-0 loc-0)', '(move loc-0 loc-1)', '(deliver paper-0 loc-1)', '(pick-up paper-1 loc-0)', '(move loc-1 loc-3)', '(deliver paper-1 loc-3)', '(pick-up paper-2 loc-0)', '(move loc-3 loc-4)', '(deliver paper-2 loc-4)', '(pick-up paper-3 loc-0)', '(move loc-4 loc-5)', '(deliver paper-3 loc-5)'].
NOTE: (pick-up paper-1 loc-0) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 3
(Set (at loc-0) to true)
Fix the code.
