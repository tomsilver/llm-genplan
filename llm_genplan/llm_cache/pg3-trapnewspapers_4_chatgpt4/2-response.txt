A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

Start at the home base location.
Pick up a newspaper.
Move to the next safe location that wants a newspaper.
Deliver the newspaper to that location.
Repeat steps 2-4 for all the remaining locations that want a newspaper.
When all locations are satisfied, the task is complete.
This strategy does not require searching through different possible paths, as it relies on sequential steps that ensure a newspaper is picked up, moved to a safe location, and delivered, satisfying all locations in the process.
