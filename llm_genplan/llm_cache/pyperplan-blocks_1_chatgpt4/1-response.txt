A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is by following a set of predefined steps:

    First, ensure that the robot hand is empty by putting down any block it might be holding.
    Clear all blocks by moving them to the table, starting from the top of each stack and working downwards.
    Once all blocks are on the table and clear, start building the desired stack(s) from the base to the top.
    a. For each block in the goal configuration, pick it up and place it on the desired lower block, one at a time.
    b. Make sure to only pick up and place blocks that are clear and satisfy the preconditions of the actions.

This strategy relies on the assumption that the given problems have a single, well-defined goal configuration. It does not require any search, as it works sequentially through the goal configuration and follows a predetermined set of steps.
