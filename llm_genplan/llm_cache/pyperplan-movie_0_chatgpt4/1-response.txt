The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a fixed sequence of actions:

    If the movie counter is at two hours, execute the rewind-movie-2 action.
    If the movie counter is at any other position than two hours, execute the rewind-movie action.
    Execute the reset-counter action.
    Execute the get-chips action with any available chips object.
    Execute the get-dip action with any available dip object.
    Execute the get-pop action with any available pop object.
    Execute the get-cheese action with any available cheese object.
    Execute the get-crackers action with any available crackers object.

By following these steps in order, you will always reach the goal state, having a rewound movie, a reset counter, and all the required snacks collected.
