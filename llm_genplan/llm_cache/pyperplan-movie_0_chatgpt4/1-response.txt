A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves sequentially performing the necessary actions in a fixed order:

    Perform the rewind-movie action if the counter is at other than two hours, or perform the rewind-movie-2 action if the counter is at two hours. This will result in a rewound movie.
    Perform the reset-counter action to set the counter to zero.
    Perform the get-chips action with any available chips object.
    Perform the get-dip action with any available dip object.
    Perform the get-pop action with any available pop object.
    Perform the get-cheese action with any available cheese object.
    Perform the get-crackers action with any available crackers object.

Following these steps will ensure that the movie is rewound, the counter is at zero, and all snack types are available, satisfying the goal of the problems in this domain.
