The simple strategy for solving all problems in this movie-strips domain without using search is to follow these steps:

    Perform the 'rewind-movie' or 'rewind-movie-2' action depending on the initial counter state. If the counter is at two hours, use 'rewind-movie-2', otherwise, use 'rewind-movie'.
    Perform the 'reset-counter' action to set the counter to zero.
    Perform the 'get-chips' action with one of the available chips objects.
    Perform the 'get-dip' action with one of the available dip objects.
    Perform the 'get-pop' action with one of the available pop objects.
    Perform the 'get-cheese' action with one of the available cheese objects.
    Perform the 'get-crackers' action with one of the available crackers objects.

By following this sequence of actions, the agent will achieve the goal state of having the movie rewound, the counter reset to zero, and all the required snacks for a movie night.
