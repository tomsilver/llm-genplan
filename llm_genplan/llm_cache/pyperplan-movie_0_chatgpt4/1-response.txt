The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps in order:

    Execute the rewind-movie action if the precondition counter-at-other-than-two-hours is true. This will set the movie-rewound effect.
    Execute the reset-counter action to set the counter-at-zero effect.
    Execute the get-chips action with any available chips object (e.g., c1). This will set the have-chips effect.
    Execute the get-dip action with any available dip object (e.g., d1). This will set the have-dip effect.
    Execute the get-pop action with any available pop object (e.g., p1). This will set the have-pop effect.
    Execute the get-cheese action with any available cheese object (e.g., z1). This will set the have-cheese effect.
    Execute the get-crackers action with any available crackers object (e.g., k1). This will set the have-crackers effect.

By following these steps sequentially, you can solve all problems in this domain without using search.
