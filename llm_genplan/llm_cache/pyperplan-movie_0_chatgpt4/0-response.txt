The movie-strips domain models the actions and predicates required to rewind a movie and gather snacks for a movie night. The predicates represent the state of the movie counter, the availability of different types of snacks, and whether they have been collected. The actions define how the movie can be rewound depending on the counter's position, resetting the counter, and collecting various snacks (chips, dip, pop, cheese, and crackers). Two example problems are provided with different snack objects to be collected, where the goal is to have a rewound movie, reset counter, and all snacks collected.
