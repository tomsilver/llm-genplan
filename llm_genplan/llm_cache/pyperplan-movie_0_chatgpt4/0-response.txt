The "movie-strips" domain is designed to represent the process of preparing for a movie night by rewinding a movie, resetting the movie counter, and gathering snacks like chips, dip, pop, cheese, and crackers. There are a variety of actions that can be taken to fulfill these objectives, such as rewinding the movie to the beginning, resetting the counter to zero, and obtaining different types of snacks. The domain also includes predicates that represent the state of the movie, counter, and snacks. Two example problems are provided, with the goal of having a rewound movie, a counter at zero, and all types of snacks available.
