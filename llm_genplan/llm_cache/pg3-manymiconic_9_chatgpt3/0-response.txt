The Miconic domain is a classical planning problem that involves a lift system that can transport passengers between floors. The domain has passengers and floors as objects, with predicates such as origin, destin, above, boarded, served, and lift-at to represent the state of the lift system and the passengers. Actions like board, depart, up, and down are used to manipulate the state of the system. The goal of the problem is to serve all passengers by transporting them to their destinations using the lift system.
