The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to use a fixed sequence of actions to move the lift and passengers to their desired floors. This strategy involves repeatedly executing a fixed sequence of actions until all passengers have been served. The sequence of actions involves moving the lift up and down between the floors and picking up and dropping off passengers at the respective floors until all passengers have reached their destinations. 

The fixed sequence of actions can be precomputed based on the initial state of the problem, the destination floors of the passengers, and the relative positions of the floors. The strategy guarantees that all passengers will eventually be served, provided that there are no conflicts or deadlock situations in the problem. However, this strategy may not always be optimal and may require a large number of actions to serve all passengers in more complex problems.
