The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow the trail directly from the initial location to the goal location, assuming it is possible to do so. This can be done by executing the "walk" action from each location to the next one on the trail until the goal location is reached. If there is a hill on the trail, the "climb" action can be executed to get to the top and then "walk" can be used again to continue along the trail. If there is a water source, the movement must stop there, and the "walk" action cannot be executed. Therefore, this strategy can only work if there are no obstacles on the trail other than hills and water sources.
