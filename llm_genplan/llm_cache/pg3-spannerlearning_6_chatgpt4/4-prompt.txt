The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(walk shed location1 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location1 spanner2 bob)', '(walk location1 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner2 bob nut2)', '(walk gate location1 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location1 spanner5 bob)', '(walk location1 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner5 bob nut4)', '(walk gate location2 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location2 spanner4 bob)', '(walk location2 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner4 bob nut1)', '(walk gate location2 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location2 spanner3 bob)', '(walk location2 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut3)'].
NOTE: (walk location1 gate bob) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 2
(Set (link location1 gate) to true)
Fix the code.
