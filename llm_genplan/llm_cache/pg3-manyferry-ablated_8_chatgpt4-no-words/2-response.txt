A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search can be derived by understanding the role of each operator and the desired goal state. Since the goal state involves updating the relationships between various objects using predicate0, we can break the problem into steps.

1. Identify the objects that need to be connected using predicate0 in the goal state.
2. For each pair of objects that need to be connected, check if the pair already satisfies the goal. If it does, move to the next pair.
3. If the pair doesn't satisfy the goal, find the objects that need to be detached and reattached. These objects should meet the preconditions for operator0 (detaching) and operator1 (reattaching).
4. Use operator2 to transfer the predicate1 property between objects if required, ensuring that the objects meet the preconditions for operator0 and operator1.
5. Apply operator0 to detach the objects that need to be reconnected.
6. Apply operator1 to reattach the objects to their desired counterparts as specified in the goal state.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all pairs of objects that need to be connected according to the goal state.

By following this strategy, you can systematically achieve the desired goal state without the need for search algorithms.
