A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to sort the objects in descending order based on their weights and then pack them one by one, starting from the heaviest object to the lightest object.

Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. Create a list of all unpacked objects.
2. Sort the list in descending order based on the 'heavier' predicate relationships.
3. For the heaviest object (the first object in the sorted list), apply the 'pack-first' action.
4. For each remaining object in the sorted list, apply the 'stack' action, placing the object on top of the previously packed object.

This strategy ensures that all objects are packed into the box, with heavier objects placed below the lighter ones, satisfying the constraints of the domain.
