A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves following these steps:

    Start at the home base (ishomebase location).
    Pick up an unpacked newspaper using the "pick-up" action.
    Move to a safe location adjacent to the destination location (wantspaper location) using the "move" action.
    Move to the destination location using the "move" action.
    Deliver the newspaper to the destination location using the "deliver" action.
    If there are more locations that want a newspaper, return to step 2. Otherwise, the task is complete, and all locations are satisfied.

By following this strategy, you can sequentially deliver newspapers to all locations without the need for searching or backtracking. This approach assumes that the agent has knowledge of the locations, their safety status, and the path to reach them.
