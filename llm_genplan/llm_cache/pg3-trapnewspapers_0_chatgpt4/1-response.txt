A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is as follows:

    Identify the home base location and the locations that want a paper.
    For each location that wants a paper, perform these steps:
    a. Pick up a paper from the home base location.
    b. Move to the location that wants the paper.
    c. Deliver the paper to the location.
    Repeat this process for all locations that want a paper.

This strategy assumes that there are enough papers at the home base for each location that wants a paper. It also assumes that there is a clear, safe path between the home base location and each location that wants a paper.
