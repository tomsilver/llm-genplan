The Miconic domain is a simple elevator control problem domain in which passengers need to be transported between floors by an elevator. The domain consists of passengers, floors, and elevator locations, and has four actions: board, depart, up, and down. The board action allows a passenger to enter the elevator, the depart action allows a passenger to exit the elevator, and the up and down actions allow the elevator to move between floors. The goal is to transport all passengers to their destinations by executing a sequence of actions.
