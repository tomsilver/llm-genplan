The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to use a simple rule-based approach that is based on the following two principles:

1. Always move the elevator to the highest floor of any passenger that has not yet been served and can be served by the elevator at the current floor.
2. Once the elevator has arrived at the floor of a passenger that needs to be served, board and depart the passenger at that floor.

This strategy can be applied iteratively until all passengers have been served. It does not require any explicit search or planning and can be implemented using simple conditionals and loops.
