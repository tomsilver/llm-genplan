A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Identify the objects of type0 that need to satisfy predicate7 (goal objects) according to the problem's goal condition.

2. For each goal object, perform the following sequence of actions:

   a. Use the "operator1" action to move predicate0 from the current type0 object (v0) to the goal object (v3), ensuring that the goal object now satisfies predicate0.
   
   b. Find an available type1 object that satisfies predicate8. If none is available, use the "operator2" action on a type1 object that satisfies predicate1 to make it satisfy predicate8.

   c. Use the "operator0" action on the goal object (v1) and the type1 object satisfying predicate8 (v2). This will make the goal object satisfy predicate7 and make the type1 object no longer satisfy predicate1.

Following these steps for each goal object will ensure that all of them will satisfy predicate7, achieving the goal without using search.
