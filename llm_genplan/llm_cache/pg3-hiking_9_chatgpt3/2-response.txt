The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always move to an adjacent location that is not water and not a hill until the goal location is reached. If the goal location is a hill, the agent should climb it instead of walking. This strategy assumes that there is always a path between any two locations that is not blocked by water or hills. Since this domain is relatively small, this simple strategy can be efficient and effective for solving all problems in the domain.
