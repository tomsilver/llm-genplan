The "heavy-pack" domain is focused on packing items into a box, considering the weight of the objects. In this domain, there are several predicates defined: heavier, packed, unpacked, nothing-above, and box-empty. The actions involved are 'pack-first', which allows an item to be packed into an empty box, and 'stack', which allows stacking a lighter item on top of a heavier item that is already packed. The main goal of the problems in this domain is to pack all objects in a manner that maintains the heavier objects at the bottom and lighter objects on top. The example problems provided list objects with their respective weights in a heavier-than relationship and require packing all the objects according to the specified conditions.
