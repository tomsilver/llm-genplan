Given this task:
(define (problem heavy-pack-prob (:domain heavy-pack)
  (:objects
    o209
    o242
    o467
    o631
    o704

  )
  (:init

    (heavier o209 o704)
    (heavier o209 o708)
    (heavier o467 o242)
    (heavier o467 o708)

    (heavier o631 o708)
    ...
    (unpacked o209)
    (unpacked o242)
    (unpacked o467)
    (unpacked o631)
    (unpacked o704)
    (unpacked o708)
    (unpacked o876)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (packed o209)
    (packed o242)
    (packed o467)
    (packed o631)
    (packed o704)
    (packed o708)
    (packed o876)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pack-first o242)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (packed o209) to true)
    and (Set (packed o467) to true)
    and (Set (packed o631) to true)
    and (Set (packed o704) to true)
    and (Set (packed o708) to true)
    and (Set (packed o876) to true)
)
Fix the code.
