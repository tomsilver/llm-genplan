The given PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain", consists of a single type called "type0." There are five predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5. Each predicate takes either one or two variables of type0 as arguments.

There are two actions in this domain: operator1 and operator0. Both actions take two parameters of type0 as input. The preconditions for both actions are similar but differ in the requirement for predicate3. Operator1 requires that predicate3 is not true for the second parameter, while operator0 requires that predicate3 is true for the second parameter. Additionally, both actions require that predicate1 is true for the first parameter and predicate4 is not true for the first parameter. The effects of both actions are the same: predicate1 becomes true for the second parameter and becomes false for the first parameter.

Two example problems, "my-problem-3" and "my-problem-2", are provided. Both problems have a set of objects of type0 and initial conditions that describe the relationships between these objects using the domain's predicates. The goal state for both problems is to have predicate1 true for specific objects (object67 and object27, respectively).
