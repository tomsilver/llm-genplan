This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain", defines a system with objects of type "type0". It involves five predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5. The domain consists of two operators, operator1 and operator0, both of which have two parameters of type "type0". The operators are used to manipulate the states of the objects based on specific preconditions and produce corresponding effects.

There are two example problems provided, "my-problem-3" and "my-problem-2". Each problem has a set of objects of type "type0", which are initialized with the given predicates in the ":init" section. The goal of each problem is to achieve a specific state of one or more objects by applying the operators in the domain. In "my-problem-3", the goal is to achieve the state (predicate1 object67), while in "my-problem-2", the goal is to achieve the state (predicate1 object27).
