The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves following these steps:

Identify the current locations of the cars and the ferry, as well as their desired final locations as specified in the goal state.
For each car, perform the following steps:
a. Sail the ferry to the car's current location.
b. Board the car onto the ferry.
c. Sail the ferry to the car's desired final location.
d. Debark the car from the ferry at the final location.
Repeat step 2 for all cars in the problem.
This strategy guarantees that each car will be moved to its desired final location. It doesn't require search since it sequentially moves one car at a time from its current location to the goal location. This approach might not be the most efficient in terms of the number of actions taken, but it will always find a solution if one exists.
