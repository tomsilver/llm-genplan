The heavy-pack domain involves packing items of different weights into a box by stacking them on top of each other. The domain includes predicates for determining the weight of items, whether they are packed or unpacked, and whether there is nothing above an item. The actions in the domain are packing an item into an empty box, and stacking a heavier unpacked item on top of a packed item, ensuring that there is nothing above the packed item. The goal of the domain is to pack all items into the box, with none of them remaining unpacked. Two example problems are provided, each with a set of objects, initial state, and goal state, that illustrate how this domain can be used to solve packing problems.
