The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves performing the actions in a specific order to achieve the goal state. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Apply 'operator2' action for each type1 object that has predicate8. This will change predicate8 to predicate1 for those type1 objects. Since 'operator2' only requires the type0 object to satisfy predicate0 and predicate3, which do not change in any action, the preconditions for 'operator2' will always hold.

2. Apply 'operator1' action for each pair of type0 objects (one with predicate0 and another without it). This ensures that every type0 object that initially had predicate6 and predicate9 now has predicate0. Since 'operator1' only changes predicate0 and doesn't affect predicate6 or predicate9, applying this action will not break the preconditions of other actions.

3. Apply 'operator0' action for each pair of type0 objects with predicate0 and predicate9, and type1 objects with predicate1. This will change predicate9 to predicate7 for the type0 objects. Since 'operator0' only requires the type0 object to satisfy predicate0, which we ensured in step 2, and the type1 object to satisfy predicate1, which we ensured in step 1, the preconditions for 'operator0' will always hold.

Following this strategy ensures that all type0 objects that initially had predicate9 will have predicate7 in the final state, which is the goal state in both example problems.
