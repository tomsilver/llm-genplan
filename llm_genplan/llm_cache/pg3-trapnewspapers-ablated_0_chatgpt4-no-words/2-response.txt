A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be derived by analyzing the dependencies between the action operators and their preconditions and effects.

Here's the strategy:
1. Apply 'operator1' with ?v0 having predicates (predicate0 and predicate6) and ?v3 being an object with predicate6. Repeat this step until all objects with predicate6 have predicate0.
2. Apply 'operator2' with ?v1 having predicates (predicate0 and predicate3) and ?v2 having predicate8. This will change predicate8 to predicate1 for ?v2.
3. Apply 'operator0' with ?v1 having predicate0 and ?v2 having predicate1. This will change predicate9 to predicate7 for ?v1 and remove predicate1 for ?v2.

Performing these steps will ensure that all objects that initially have predicate9 will have predicate7, which is the goal state for all given problems in this domain. Since the actions are applied in a specific order and don't interfere with each other, no search is needed to solve the problems.
