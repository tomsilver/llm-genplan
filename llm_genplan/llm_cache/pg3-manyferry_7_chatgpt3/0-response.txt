The ferry domain is a planning problem where cars need to be transported from one location to another by a ferry. The domain includes predicates to represent the location of the cars and the ferry, as well as actions to sail the ferry from one location to another, board cars onto the ferry, and debark cars from the ferry. The goal is to move specific cars to specific locations. The problem involves specifying the initial state of the cars and the ferry, as well as the desired goal state, and finding a sequence of actions to achieve the goal.
