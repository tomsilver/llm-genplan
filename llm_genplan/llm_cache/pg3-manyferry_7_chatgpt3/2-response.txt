The simple strategy for solving all problems in the ferry domain without using search is to use the graph structure of the problem and apply a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. This can be done by creating a graph where each node represents a possible state of the problem, and the edges between nodes represent the actions that can be taken to transition from one state to another. Then, a breadth-first search can be applied to this graph to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. Since the ferry domain has a relatively small state space, this approach can be used to solve all problems in the domain without the need for more complex search algorithms.
