The heavy-pack domain involves packing a set of objects into a box while adhering to certain constraints. The domain has two actions: "pack-first" which packs the first item into an empty box, and "stack" which stacks a new item on top of an already packed item if it is heavier and the previous item has nothing on top of it. The domain includes predicates to represent the packed and unpacked states of an object, the relative weight of objects, and whether there is nothing on top of an object. The goal of each problem is to pack all objects into the box.
