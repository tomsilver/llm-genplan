Given this task:
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)

The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(walk shed location1 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location1 spanner3 bob)', '(walk location1 location2 bob)', '(walk location2 location3 bob)', '(walk location3 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut2)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut4)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut1)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut3)'].
NOTE: (tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut4) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 6
(Set (useable spanner3) to true)
Fix the code.
