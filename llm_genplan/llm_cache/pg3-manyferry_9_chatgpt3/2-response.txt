The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to first load all the cars onto the ferry, then sail across the river to the other side, and finally unload all the cars from the ferry. This strategy ensures that all cars end up at their desired locations without violating any of the domain predicates or requirements. This strategy relies on the fact that there is only one ferry and it can carry all the cars at once. Since there are no capacity constraints on the ferry, this strategy is guaranteed to work for all problems in the domain.
