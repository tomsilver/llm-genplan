There might be a few reasons why the code is failing to find a plan to satisfy the goal. Here are some possible issues:

1. The given initial state may not have a solution that leads to the goal state. This could happen if, for example, there is no path from the initial location to the goal location that satisfies the domain constraints.

2. The implementation of the `get_plan()` function may have a bug that prevents it from finding a valid plan.

3. There could be a typo or other error in the problem specification or domain definition.

To fix the code, we can try the following:

1. Double-check the problem specification and domain definition to make sure there are no errors or typos.

2. Verify that the `get_plan()` function is correctly implemented and is able to find a valid plan for other problems in the same domain.

3. Check if there are any missing or incorrect initial state conditions that could prevent the goal from being satisfied.

4. Try a different approach to finding a plan, such as using a different search algorithm or adding heuristics to guide the search.
