The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(walk shed location1 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location1 spanner5 bob)', '(walk location1 location2 bob)', '(walk location2 location3 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location3 spanner3 bob)', '(walk location3 location4 bob)', '(walk location4 location5 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location5 spanner1 bob)', '(walk location5 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner1 bob nut2)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (tightened nut1) to true)
    and (Set (tightened nut3) to true)
    and (Set (tightened nut4) to true)
)
Fix the code.
