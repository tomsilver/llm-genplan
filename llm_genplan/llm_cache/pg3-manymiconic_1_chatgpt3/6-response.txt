Here is the fixed code:

```python
def passenger_on_board_above(floor):
    return any(('destin', p, f) in init and ('boarded', p) in init and f > floor for p, t in objects if t == 'passenger' for _, _, f in init if p in _)

def passenger_waiting_above(floor):
    return any(('origin', p, f) in init and f > floor for p, t in objects if t == 'passenger' for _, _, f in init)
```

In the original code, `f` was not defined in the comprehension, causing a `NameError`. I added an additional loop over the `init` state to retrieve the floor variable for each passenger-related predicate.
