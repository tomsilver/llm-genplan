A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search can be derived by analyzing the given actions and their effects. Here is the strategy:

1. Apply the "operator0" action:
Since predicate0 is initially true and applying "operator0" negates predicate0, this action can be executed exactly once. Choose any object, and execute the "operator0" action on it. This will make predicates 4 and 2 true for the chosen object, and negate predicate 6 for it.

2. Apply the "operator1" action:
Now that we have one object with predicates 4 and 2, we can use this object as a source to propagate these predicates to other objects using "operator1". For each remaining object with predicate6 true, find a pair (?v0, ?v4) where ?v0 is the object with predicates 4 and 2, and ?v4 is the object we want to modify. Since predicate1 defines connections between objects, such pairs should exist as long as the problem is solvable. Apply "operator1" on each pair, which will transfer predicates 4 and 2 from the source object to the target object, and negate predicate 6 for the target object.

Following these two steps, all objects will have predicate4 true, achieving the goal for all problems in this domain.
