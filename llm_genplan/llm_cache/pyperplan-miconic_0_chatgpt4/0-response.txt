The Miconic domain represents a simple elevator system, which involves managing passengers and floors. The domain has two types of objects: passengers and floors. The predicates define the origin and destination floors for each passenger, whether the passenger has boarded or not, whether the passenger has reached their destination, the position of the lift, and the relative positions of floors.

There are four actions in this domain: board, depart, up, and down. The "board" action allows a passenger to board the lift when it is at their origin floor. The "depart" action allows a passenger to exit the lift when it reaches their destination floor. The "up" action moves the lift from one floor to a floor above it, and the "down" action moves the lift from one floor to a floor below it. The objective of the problems in this domain is to serve all passengers by moving the lift in such a way that they can board and alight at their respective origin and destination floors.
