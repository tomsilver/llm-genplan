A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is the "Sweep" or "Scan" strategy. The elevator starts from the lowest floor and moves upward, stopping at each floor to pick up and drop off passengers. When it reaches the top floor, it reverses direction and moves downward, again stopping at each floor to pick up and drop off passengers. This process continues until all passengers have been served.

In this strategy, the elevator does not optimize its movement based on the specific origin and destination of passengers. However, it guarantees that all passengers will eventually be served, as the elevator will eventually visit every floor in both directions. Although this approach may not be the most efficient in terms of total actions or time, it ensures that all problems in the domain can be solved without performing a search through the state space.
