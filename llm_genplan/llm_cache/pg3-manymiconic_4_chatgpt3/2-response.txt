The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to implement a fixed sequence of actions that moves the elevator up and down between floors and stops at the floors where passengers are waiting or need to be dropped off. This sequence of actions is determined based on the initial locations of the passengers and their destinations, and the floors they need to be picked up and dropped off at. This strategy is sometimes called a "planning graph" approach, where the sequence of actions is determined based on a graph that represents the relationships between the initial state, goal state, and actions in the domain. The planning graph approach can be implemented using various techniques such as STRIPS or ADL, and can be optimized for efficiency by eliminating redundant actions or combining multiple actions into a single step.
