The Miconic domain is a simplified model of an elevator system where passengers need to be transported between floors of a building. The domain includes actions for the elevator to move up or down between floors, for passengers to board and depart the elevator at specific floors, and predicates to track the location and status of passengers and the elevator. The problem instances define the initial state of the elevator and passengers, their destinations, and the desired goal state where all passengers have been transported to their destinations.
