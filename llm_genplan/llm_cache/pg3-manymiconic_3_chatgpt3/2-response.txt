The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to use a fixed sequence of actions that will ensure that all passengers are transported to their destinations. The sequence consists of repeatedly moving the lift up or down to the highest or lowest floor that has waiting passengers, stopping at each floor to board and then depart passengers.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Check if there are any waiting passengers on the current floor. If so, board them.

2. Determine the direction in which the lift needs to move (up or down) based on the destination floors of the remaining waiting passengers.

3. Move the lift in the determined direction to the highest or lowest floor with waiting passengers.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all passengers have been transported to their destinations.

This algorithm ensures that all passengers will eventually reach their destinations without the need for search, as it always moves the lift in the direction of the waiting passengers and stops at every floor with waiting passengers to pick them up. However, this strategy may not be the most efficient way to solve larger problems in the domain, as it may require unnecessary trips up and down the building.
