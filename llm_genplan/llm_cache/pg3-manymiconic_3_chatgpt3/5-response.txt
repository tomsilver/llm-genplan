The error seems to be happening in the middle of a condition in the code. It is likely that there is an error in the condition itself or in the syntax used to write it.

Without seeing the code it is difficult to say exactly what the error is, but one possible issue could be a missing closing parenthesis or a missing colon.

Here are some steps to try to fix the code:

1. Check the line where the error occurred and look for any obvious syntax errors or typos.

2. Make sure that any open parentheses or brackets have a corresponding closing one.

3. Check if any colons or commas are missing in the line or if any extra ones are present.

4. Check if the condition in the line is correctly formatted and that all the necessary parentheses and logical operators are present.

5. Check if there are any other syntax errors in the code, such as missing or extra quotation marks or incorrect variable names.

Once you have identified the issue, try to fix it and run the code again to see if the error has been resolved.
