A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be achieved by following a sequence of steps, relying on the understanding of the operators' preconditions and effects. Here's the strategy:

1. Identify the goal state: Analyze the goal state and find the required predicate0 relationships between objects.

2. For each desired predicate0 relationship, do the following:
   a. Check the current state of predicate0 relationships.
   b. If the desired predicate0 relationship already exists, move on to the next goal.
   c. If the desired predicate0 relationship does not exist, follow these sub-steps:
      i. Apply operator1 on the object pair to remove the existing predicate0 relationship and set the predicate8 property for the first object.
      ii. Apply operator2 to switch the predicate1 property between the second objects involved in the existing and desired predicate0 relationships.
      iii. Apply operator0 on the object pair to create the desired predicate0 relationship and remove the predicate8 property for the first object.

This strategy effectively achieves the goal state by iteratively working on each desired predicate0 relationship and updating the predicate1 properties and predicate0 relationships using the operators. Since we are directly applying operators based on the goal state and initial conditions, there is no need for search.
