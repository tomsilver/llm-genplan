I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding. I meant for you to replace the "..." in the problem definition in the PDDL file, not in the code. Here is the revised problem definition:

```lisp
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)
  (:objects
    gate - location
    location1 - location
    location2 - location
    location3 - location
    location4 - location
    shed - location
    bob - man
    nut1 - nut
    nut2 - nut
    nut3 - nut
    nut4 - nut
    nut5 - nut
    spanner1 - spanner
    spanner2 - spanner
    spanner3 - spanner
    spanner4 - spanner
    spanner5 - spanner
  )
  (:init
    (at bob shed)
    (at nut1 gate)
    (at nut2 gate)
    (at nut3 gate)
    (at nut4 gate)
    (at nut5 gate)
    (at spanner1 location2)
    (at spanner2 location3)
    (at spanner3 location1)
    (at spanner4 location4)
    (at spanner5 location1)  ; Add the missing spanner location
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
    (link location3 location4)
    (link location4 gate)
    (link shed location1)
    (loose nut1)
    (loose nut2)
    (loose nut3)
    (loose nut4)
    (loose nut5)
    (useable spanner1)
    (useable spanner2)
    (useable spanner3)
    (useable spanner4)
    (useable spanner5)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (tightened nut1)
    (tightened nut2)
    (tightened nut3)
    (tightened nut4)
    (tightened nut5)
    )
  )    
)
```

Now please re-run the code using this corrected problem definition, and it should work properly.
