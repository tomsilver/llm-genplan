The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed

    I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding. I meant for you to replace the "..." in the problem definition in the PDDL file, not in the code. Here is the revised problem definition:
      ^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Fix the code.
