A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search would involve applying the actions operator0, operator1, and operator2 in a sequential and deterministic manner based on the initial and goal states of the problem.

1. Identify the desired relationships in the goal state.
2. For each object in the goal state with a predicate0 relationship, perform the following steps:
   a. If the object's current relationship is different from the goal state, apply operator0 to remove the current relationship.
   b. Apply operator1 to establish the relationship specified in the goal state.
3. For each pair of objects in the goal state where one object should have predicate1 property, perform the following steps:
   a. If the object with predicate1 is different from the goal state, apply operator2 to transfer the predicate1 property from the current object to the desired object.

By following this strategy, we can systematically modify the relationships and properties of the objects to match the goal state without using search.
