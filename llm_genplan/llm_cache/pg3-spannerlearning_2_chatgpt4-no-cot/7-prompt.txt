Given this task:
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)
  (:objects
    gate - location
    location1 - location
    location2 - location
    location3 - location
    location4 - location
    shed - location
    bob - man
    nut1 - nut
    nut2 - nut
    nut3 - nut
    spanner1 - spanner
    spanner2 - spanner
    spanner3 - spanner
  )
  (:init
    (at bob shed)
    (at nut1 gate)
    (at nut2 gate)
    (at nut3 gate)
    (at spanner1 location1)
    (at spanner2 location1)
    (at spanner3 location1)
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
    (link location3 location4)
    (link location4 gate)
    (link shed location1)
    (loose nut1)
    (loose nut2)
    (loose nut3)
    (useable spanner1)
    (useable spanner2)
    (useable spanner3)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (tightened nut1)
    (tightened nut2)
    (tightened nut3)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(walk shed location1 bob)', '(pickup_spanner location1 spanner3 bob)', '(walk location1 location2 bob)', '(walk location2 location3 bob)', '(walk location3 location4 bob)', '(walk location4 gate bob)', '(tighten_nut gate spanner3 bob nut2)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (tightened nut1) to true)
    and (Set (tightened nut3) to true)
)
Fix the code.
