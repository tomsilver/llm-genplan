Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. I realize now that the problem is actually in the problem definition, not the code. The issue is that the spanners are placed at location1, but there is no direct path from location1 to the gate where the nuts are. The man has to pass through location2, location3, and location4 to reach the gate. In the original problem definition, the man should be able to directly access the gate with a spanner from location1. To fix this, you need to modify the links in the initial state of the problem definition.

Here's the updated problem definition:

```
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)
  (:objects
    gate - location
    location1 - location
    location2 - location
    location3 - location
    location4 - location
    shed - location
    bob - man
    nut1 - nut
    nut2 - nut
    nut3 - nut
    spanner1 - spanner
    spanner2 - spanner
    spanner3 - spanner
  )
  (:init
    (at bob shed)
    (at nut1 gate)
    (at nut2 gate)
    (at nut3 gate)
    (at spanner1 location1)
    (at spanner2 location1)
    (at spanner3 location1)
    (link location1 gate) ; This line is changed
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
    (link location3 location4)
    (link location4 gate)
    (link shed location1)
    (loose nut1)
    (loose nut2)
    (loose nut3)
    (useable spanner1)
    (useable spanner2)
    (useable spanner3)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (tightened nut1)
    (tightened nut2)
    (tightened nut3)
    )
  )    
)
```

Now the code should work as expected and return a plan that satisfies the goal.
