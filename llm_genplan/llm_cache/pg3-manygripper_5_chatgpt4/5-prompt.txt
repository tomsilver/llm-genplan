The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(move room8 room18)', '(pick ball3 room8 gripper1)', '(move room8 room18)', '(drop ball3 room18 gripper1)', '(move room16 room1)', '(pick ball6 room16 gripper1)', '(move room16 room1)', '(drop ball6 room1 gripper1)', '(move room9 room11)', '(pick ball2 room9 gripper1)', '(move room9 room11)', '(drop ball2 room11 gripper1)', '(move room6 room9)', '(pick ball0 room6 gripper1)', '(move room6 room9)', '(drop ball0 room9 gripper1)', '(move room16 room15)', '(pick ball7 room16 gripper1)', '(move room16 room15)', '(drop ball7 room15 gripper1)'].
NOTE: (move room8 room18) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 0
(Set (at-robby room8) to true)
Fix the code.
