A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

Identify the location of each loose nut that needs to be tightened.
For each loose nut, find the nearest usable spanner.
For each loose nut and its nearest spanner, have Bob walk from his current location to the spanner location, pick up the spanner, then walk to the nut location.
Tighten the nut using the picked-up spanner.
Repeat steps 1-4 for all the loose nuts.
This strategy ensures that Bob tightens all the loose nuts using the nearest spanners without needing to search through possible sequences of actions.
