A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Start at Bob's initial location (usually the shed).
2. Follow the linked locations in order until reaching the gate with loose nuts. 
3. While traversing the locations, pick up any spanner found along the way. Note that Bob can carry multiple spanners.
4. When reaching the gate, tighten each nut sequentially using the available spanners. If a spanner becomes unusable after tightening a nut, discard it and use the next available spanner.
5. If all nuts are tightened, the problem is solved. If any nuts remain loose, go back to step 2 and continue traversing the linked locations to find more spanners.

This strategy ensures that Bob picks up all available spanners and attempts to tighten all nuts without using a search algorithm. However, it may not be the most efficient solution as it does not account for the optimal order of picking up spanners and tightening nuts.
