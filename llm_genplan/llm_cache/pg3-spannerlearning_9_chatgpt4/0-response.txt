The "spanner" domain involves a man, Bob, who needs to tighten a set of loose nuts at a gate. The domain includes various objects like locations, the man, nuts, and spanners. The domain has three main actions: walk, pickup_spanner, and tighten_nut. Bob can walk between locations, pick up spanners, and use them to tighten the loose nuts. The goal is to have all the nuts tightened.

In the example problems, Bob starts at a shed and must navigate through a series of connected locations to reach the gate with loose nuts. Spanners are placed at different locations, and Bob needs to pick them up and use them to tighten the nuts. Each problem has a different set of locations and spanner placements. The objective is to find a sequence of actions that allows Bob to tighten all the nuts.
