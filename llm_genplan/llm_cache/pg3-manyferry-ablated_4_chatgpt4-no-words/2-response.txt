A simple strategy to solve problems in this domain without using search involves a sequential application of the available operators to achieve the goal state. This strategy assumes that there are no conflicting actions, and the goal state can be achieved by applying the actions in a certain order. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the goal predicate0 relationships between objects.
2. For each goal predicate0 relationship (x, y), check if it already exists in the initial state. If not, proceed to the next steps.
3. Apply operator1 to remove the current predicate0 relationship of the object x (if any), by turning it into a predicate8 relationship.
4. Apply operator2 to change the predicate1 property from its current object to object y, provided that the objects satisfy the predicate7 relationship.
5. Apply operator0 to create the desired predicate0 relationship (x, y) using the predicate8 relationship of x and predicate1 property of y.

Repeat these steps for each goal predicate0 relationship until all of them are established in the current state. This strategy does not involve any search or backtracking, but it relies on the assumption that the actions do not interfere with each other or create unsolvable situations.
