The heavy-pack domain is focused on packing items in a box, while ensuring that heavier items are placed below lighter ones. There are two main actions in this domain: pack-first and stack. The pack-first action puts the first item in the empty box, while the stack action places an item on top of another, making sure the bottom item is heavier than the top one. The domain also defines several predicates, such as heavier, packed, unpacked, nothing-above, and box-empty. The example problems provided involve packing a set of items with specific weight relationships, with the goal of having all items packed in the box while maintaining the required order.
