The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is as follows:

1. Sort the items in descending order according to their weights. This can be done using the given 'heavier' predicates to determine the weight relationships between items.
2. Perform the 'pack-first' action on the heaviest item (the first item in the sorted list).
3. Iterate through the remaining items in the sorted list and perform the 'stack' action, placing each item on top of the previously packed item.

By following this strategy, you ensure that all items are packed in the box while maintaining the required order of having heavier items below lighter ones.
