The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

Move the ferry to the location of the car that needs to be transported.
Board the car onto the ferry.
Sail the ferry to the destination location of the car.
Debark the car at the destination location.
Mark the ferry as empty.
Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each car that needs to be transported.
Since there is only one car allowed on the ferry at a time and the ferry is initially empty, this strategy ensures that each car is transported to its destination one at a time, avoiding conflicts or the need for complex search algorithms.
