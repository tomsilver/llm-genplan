The "Trap Newspapers" domain is a planning problem in which a robot has to deliver newspapers to certain locations while avoiding traps that can damage the newspapers. The domain involves two types of objects: locations and newspapers. The robot can pick up a newspaper if it is at the home base and the newspaper is unpacked. It can move between locations as long as the location is safe. It can deliver a newspaper to a location if it is currently carrying the newspaper and the location wants the newspaper. The goal is for the robot to satisfy the newspaper requests of certain locations while avoiding traps.
