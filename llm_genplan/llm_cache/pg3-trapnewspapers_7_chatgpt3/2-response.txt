The simple strategy for solving all problems in the "Trap Newspapers" domain without using search is as follows:

1. Pick up all unpacked newspapers at the home base.
2. Deliver each newspaper to the location that wants it while avoiding traps.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all locations have been satisfied.

This strategy works because the domain is relatively small and there are no obstacles or other factors that would require more complex planning. By systematically picking up all unpacked newspapers and delivering them to the desired locations, the robot can satisfy all location requests without running into traps. However, this strategy assumes that the robot has enough capacity to carry all newspapers at once, and that there are no conflicts between location requests.
