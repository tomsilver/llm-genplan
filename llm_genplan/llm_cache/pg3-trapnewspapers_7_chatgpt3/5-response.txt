The exception message suggests that there is a syntax error in the problem definition, specifically in the line that defines the problem name and domain. The error message indicates that the `(` character after `newspaper` may be causing the issue.

The problem is that the problem name and domain should be defined in separate parentheses, but they are currently grouped together in a single set of parentheses. To fix the code, we need to separate the problem name and domain into two separate sets of parentheses. 

Here's the corrected problem definition:

```python
(define (problem newspaper)
  (:domain trapnewspapers)
  (:objects
    loc-0 - loc
    loc-1 - loc
    loc-2 - loc
    loc-3 - loc
    loc-4 - loc
    loc-5 - loc
    loc-6 - loc
    loc-7 - loc
    loc-8 - loc
    paper-0 - paper
    paper-1 - paper
    paper-2 - paper
  )
  (:init
    (at loc-0)
    (ishomebase loc-0)
    (safe loc-0)
    (safe loc-1)
    (safe loc-3)
    (safe loc-6)
    (unpacked paper-0)
    (unpacked paper-1)
    (unpacked paper-2)
    (wantspaper loc-1)
    (wantspaper loc-3)
    (wantspaper loc-6)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (satisfied loc-1)
    (satisfied loc-3)
    (satisfied loc-6)
    )
  )    
)
```

With this modification, the code should run without raising a syntax error.
