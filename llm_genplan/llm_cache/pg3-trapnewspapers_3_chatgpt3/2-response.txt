The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always deliver newspapers directly to the location that wants them, whenever possible. This means that, as soon as a newspaper is picked up from the home base and is available for delivery, it should be delivered directly to the location that wants it. In situations where multiple locations want newspapers and it is not possible to deliver all newspapers directly to the corresponding locations due to safety constraints, the newspapers should be moved to a safe location first and then delivered from there. This strategy avoids unnecessary movements and optimizes the delivery process, and it can be implemented using conditional effects in the domain definition.
