This is a domain for a newspaper delivery problem. The domain defines various predicates such as location, home base, satisfaction, and packing status of newspapers, as well as actions like picking up, delivering, and moving newspapers to various locations. The problem is to satisfy the wantspaper predicate of certain locations by delivering newspapers to them, while ensuring that the newspapers are safely carried and not damaged during transport. The domain includes two example problems, with different locations and newspapers, each with the goal of satisfying the wantspaper predicate of multiple locations.
