Given this task:
(define (problem newspaper (:domain trapnewspapers)
  (:objects
    loc-0 - loc
    loc-1 - loc
    loc-2 - loc
    loc-3 - loc
    loc-4 - loc
    loc-5 - loc
    loc-6 - loc
    paper-0 - paper
    paper-1 - paper
  )
  (:init
    (at loc-0)
    (ishomebase loc-0)
    (safe loc-0)
    (safe loc-3)
    (safe loc-6)
    (unpacked paper-0)
    (unpacked paper-1)
    (wantspaper loc-3)
    (wantspaper loc-6)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (satisfied loc-3)
    (satisfied loc-6)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pick-up paper-0 loc-0)', '(pick-up paper-1 loc-0)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (satisfied loc-3) to true)
    and (Set (satisfied loc-6) to true)
)
Fix the code.
