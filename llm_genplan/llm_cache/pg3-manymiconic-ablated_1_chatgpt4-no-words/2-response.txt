The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves a sequential execution of actions (operators) following a specific order:

1. Apply the `operator0` action for each type2 object (`?v6`) and type0 object (`?v0`) where `predicate6 ?v0` and `predicate7 ?v6 ?v0` are true. This will make `predicate2 ?v6` true for each type2 object.

2. Apply the `operator1` action for each type2 object (`?v6`) and type0 object (`?v0`) where `predicate6 ?v0`, `predicate4 ?v6 ?v0`, and `predicate2 ?v6` are true. This will make `predicate8 ?v6` true for each type2 object, which is the ultimate goal.

3. If there are type0 objects to be moved according to `predicate0`, apply either `operator2` or `operator3` actions (depending on the specific precondition) to move the type0 objects as required by the problem statement.

Following this sequential strategy, you will reach the goal state of having `predicate8 ?v6` true for all required type2 objects, without needing to perform any search.
