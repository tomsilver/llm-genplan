The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `pddl_planning` module is not installed or cannot be found. To fix the code, we need to install the `pddl_planning` module using `pip`. Here are the steps to fix the code:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Run the command `pip install pddl_planning` to install the `pddl_planning` module.
3. After the installation is complete, try running the code again.

If the code still raises a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure that the `pip` command is installed and that you are running it with the correct Python environment.

Once the `pddl_planning` module is installed, the code should run without any errors.
