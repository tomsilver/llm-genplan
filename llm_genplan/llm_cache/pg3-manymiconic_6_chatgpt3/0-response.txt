The Miconic domain models a simple elevator system, where passengers can request to be transported between floors using the elevator. The domain consists of floors and passengers, and predicates to represent the location of passengers and the elevator, as well as whether a passenger has been served by the elevator. The actions include boarding and departing the elevator, as well as moving the elevator between floors. The two example problems involve specifying the initial locations and destinations of passengers, as well as the initial location of the elevator, and the goal of serving all passengers.
