The error suggests that there is a missing module named `pddl_planning` that the code is trying to import. To fix the code, we need to make sure that the `pddl_planning` module is installed and accessible in the environment.

If you are using pip, you can install the `pddl_planning` module by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pddl_planning
```

```

After installing the `pddl_planning` module, the code should run without any errors.
