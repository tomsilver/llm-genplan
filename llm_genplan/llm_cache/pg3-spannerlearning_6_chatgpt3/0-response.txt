The "Spanner" domain is a simple planning domain that involves a man, nuts, and spanners, where the goal is to tighten all nuts. The domain includes locations and locatables, such as a gate, shed, and different locations for nuts and spanners. The domain also includes actions such as walking, picking up a spanner, and tightening a nut with a spanner, with preconditions and effects that are based on the locations of the man, spanners, nuts, and their states of tightness and usability. Two example problems are provided, with different sets of locations and initial states for the spanners, nuts, and man, but both share the same goal of tightening all nuts.
