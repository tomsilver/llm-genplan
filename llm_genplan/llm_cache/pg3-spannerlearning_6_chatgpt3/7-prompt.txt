The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed

    I'm sorry, but this task seems to be a duplicate of a previous one I already addressed. Can you please provide a different task or clarify if there is an error in the previous response I provided?

SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 4)

Fix the code.
