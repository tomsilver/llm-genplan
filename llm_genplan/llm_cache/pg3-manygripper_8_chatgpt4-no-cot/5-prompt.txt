The code returned this plan: ['(move room13)', '(pick ball6 room13 gripper0)', '(move room6)', '(drop ball6 room6 gripper0)', '(move room17)', '(pick ball7 room17 gripper0)', '(move room18)', '(drop ball7 room18 gripper0)', '(move room17)', '(pick ball0 room17 gripper0)', '(move room14)', '(drop ball0 room14 gripper0)', '(move room9)', '(pick ball1 room9 gripper0)', '(move room4)', '(drop ball1 room4 gripper0)', '(move room16)', '(pick ball5 room16 gripper0)', '(move room9)', '(drop ball5 room9 gripper0)']
However, the action (move room13) is invalid at step 0.
NOTE: the valid operators are: (drop ?obj ?room ?gripper) (move ?from ?to) (pick ?obj ?room ?gripper).
Fix the code.
