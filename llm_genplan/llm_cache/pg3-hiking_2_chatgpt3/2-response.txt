The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always move in the direction of the goal location while avoiding any hills or water. This can be achieved by following the trail that leads towards the goal location, if it exists. If no trail exists, the agent can move to any adjacent location that is not a hill or water, and then continue to move in the direction of the goal. This strategy ensures that the agent reaches the goal while avoiding obstacles and taking the shortest possible route. Since this strategy does not involve search, it is guaranteed to find a solution in constant time and space complexity.
