The hiking domain is a planning domain in which an agent can move between locations that are either hills, water, or normal terrain. The agent can walk between adjacent locations, but must climb to reach a hill location. The agent's objective is to reach a specified goal location. The domain includes predicates for the agent's location, the type of terrain at each location, and the adjacency relationship between locations, as well as actions for walking and climbing. The problems defined in this domain specify initial state and goal state, as well as the terrain types and locations of interest.
