The simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to apply operator0 to all objects sequentially and then apply operator1 to each pair of objects that have a predicate1 relationship.

Here's the strategy in detail:

1. First, apply operator0 to every object in the problem. This will remove predicate0 (as it is a global predicate), add predicate4 and predicate2 to all objects, and remove predicate6 from all objects.

2. Then, for each pair of objects (?v0, ?v4) with a predicate1 relationship, apply operator1. Since all objects now have predicate4 and predicate2 properties after applying operator0, and no object has predicate6, the preconditions for operator1 will be satisfied. Applying operator1 to each pair will maintain the predicate4 property for both objects while removing predicate2 from the first object (?v0) and keeping it for the second object (?v4).

After applying this strategy, all objects will have predicate4, which is the goal state for all problems in this domain.
