This PDDL domain, called "my-pddl-domain," consists of a single type named "type0." There are five predicates defined in the domain: predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5. Predicate0 takes two arguments of type0, while the others take one argument of type0 each.

Two operators are defined in the domain: operator1 and operator0. Both operators take two parameters of type0. Operator1 has a precondition that requires predicate1 to hold for the first parameter, predicate0 to hold between the two parameters, and predicate3 and predicate4 not to hold for the second parameter. Its effect is to transfer predicate1 from the first parameter to the second parameter. Operator0 has a similar precondition and effect as operator1, but requires predicate3 to hold for the second parameter instead of not holding.

Two example problems are provided, my-problem-3 and my-problem-2. In both problems, a set of objects of type0 are given, along with a series of predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5 relationships among the objects. The goal for both problems is to make predicate1 hold for a specific object. The problems differ in their initial states and goal objects.
