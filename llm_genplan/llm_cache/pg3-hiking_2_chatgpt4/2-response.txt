A simple strategy to solve problems in this domain without using search is to employ a greedy algorithm that moves the hiker step-by-step towards the goal, selecting the next location based on a heuristic. The heuristic can be the Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance to the goal. At each step, the hiker can choose from the adjacent non-water locations that minimize the heuristic distance to the goal. If the next location is a hill, use the "climb" action; otherwise, use the "walk" action.

This greedy strategy works well in simple cases where there are no complex obstacles or dead-ends. However, it may not always find the optimal solution or even a solution at all in cases with more complicated environments, as it doesn't consider the global structure of the terrain.
