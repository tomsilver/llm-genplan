The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code

    It appears that the precondition (above f5_b0 f5_b1) is not satisfied in the initial state of the problem, which is causing the failure in the plan execution. To fix the code, you need to add this precondition in the (:init ...) section. Here's the corrected problem definition:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 107)

Fix the code.
