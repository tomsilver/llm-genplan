The gripper-strips domain is a simple robotics domain where a robot, named Robby, is able to move between different rooms and pick up and drop off balls using grippers. The domain includes predicates for rooms, balls, grippers, and their locations, as well as actions for moving Robby, picking up balls with a gripper, and dropping balls from a gripper. The goal of each problem instance is to move the balls to specific locations in the rooms. The problems specify the initial locations of balls, grippers, and Robby, as well as the desired locations of the balls in the goal.
