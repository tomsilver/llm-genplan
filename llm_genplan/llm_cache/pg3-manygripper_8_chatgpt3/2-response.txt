The simple strategy for solving all problems in the gripper-strips domain without using search is to always choose the closest ball to the current position of the robot, pick it up with a free gripper, and move it to the goal position of the ball. This strategy is based on the fact that the domain does not have any obstacles or restrictions on the movements of the robot or the balls, and assumes that the robot is able to move freely between any two adjacent rooms in a single action. This strategy can be implemented using a simple algorithm that repeatedly selects the closest ball to the robot, picks it up, and moves it to its goal position until all balls have been moved to their respective goal positions.
