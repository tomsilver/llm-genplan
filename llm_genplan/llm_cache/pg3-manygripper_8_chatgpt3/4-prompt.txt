The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 19, in get_plan
    robot_position = [atom[2] for atom in init if atom[0] == 'at-robby'][0]
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                      ~~~~^^^

Fix the code.
