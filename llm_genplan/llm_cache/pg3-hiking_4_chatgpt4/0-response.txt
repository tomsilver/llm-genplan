The "hiking" domain is designed to model the problem of navigating a hiker through a grid of locations with different terrain types like hills and water bodies. It consists of two actions: walk and climb, and several predicates that represent the current location of the hiker, the type of terrain at each location, and the adjacency of locations.

The "walk" action allows the hiker to move from one location to another, as long as the destination is not a hill and is adjacent to the current location. The "climb" action allows the hiker to move to a hill location, as long as it is adjacent to the current location.

The predicates include "at" to represent the hiker's current location, "iswater" and "ishill" to indicate if a location is a water body or a hill, respectively, "adjacent" to indicate if two locations are adjacent, and "ontrail" to represent a trail connection between two locations.

The example problems provide an initial state of the grid with specific locations for hills, water, and the hiker's starting point. The goal state is defined as reaching a specific location on the grid.
