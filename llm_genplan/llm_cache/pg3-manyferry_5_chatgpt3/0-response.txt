The ferry domain involves moving cars between different locations using a ferry. The domain has predicates for cars, locations, and their positions on the ferry. The actions in the domain include "sail," "board," and "debark," which respectively move the ferry from one location to another, board a car onto the ferry, and debark a car from the ferry. The two example problems involve moving three cars to specific locations in a given initial state.
