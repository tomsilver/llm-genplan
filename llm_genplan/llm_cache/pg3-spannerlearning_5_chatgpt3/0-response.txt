The "Spanner" domain models a simple scenario where a man needs to use a spanner to tighten nuts in order to achieve a specific goal. The domain includes several types of objects, including locations, men, nuts, and spanners, and several predicates that represent their relationships and states. The actions available in the domain include walking between locations, picking up a spanner, and tightening a nut with a spanner. The goal of the problems is to tighten all the nuts, which requires the use of specific spanners located at different positions in the domain. The problems specify the initial positions of the objects and the goal state.
