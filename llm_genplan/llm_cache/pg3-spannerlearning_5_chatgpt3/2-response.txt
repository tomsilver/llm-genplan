The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to simply iterate through all the nuts in the domain, and for each nut, find the spanner that can be used to tighten it. Once the required spanner is identified, the man can move to its location, pick it up, move to the location of the nut, and use it to tighten the nut. This process is repeated for each nut until all nuts have been tightened, and the goal state is achieved.

This strategy can be implemented using a loop that iterates over the nuts and performs the necessary actions for each nut using conditional statements to check which spanner to use. The implementation can keep track of the locations of the man, spanners, and nuts, and update them after each action. Once all the nuts have been tightened, the implementation can check if the goal state has been achieved and terminate if it has, or continue the loop if it has not.
