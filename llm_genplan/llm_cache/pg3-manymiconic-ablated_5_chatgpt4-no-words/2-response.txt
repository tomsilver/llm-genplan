The simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to sequentially apply the actions in a specific order to achieve the goal of having predicate8 property for all objects of type2. Here's the strategy:

1. Identify all pairs of objects with predicate7 and predicate4 relations.
2. For each pair (type0, type2) with predicate7 relation:
    a. Apply operator0 to add the predicate2 property to the type2 object.
3. For each pair (type0, type2) with predicate4 relation:
    a. If the type2 object has the predicate2 property:
        i. Apply operator1 to remove the predicate2 property and add the predicate8 property to the type2 object.
    b. If the type2 object doesn't have the predicate2 property:
        i. Find another object of type0 (type0_new) that has a predicate0 relation with the current type0 object.
        ii. Apply operator3 (or operator2, depending on the order of objects in the predicate0 relation) to transfer the predicate6 property from the current type0 object to type0_new.
        iii. Apply operator0 to add the predicate2 property to the type2 object.
        iv. Apply operator1 to remove the predicate2 property and add the predicate8 property to the type2 object.

This strategy ensures that all objects of type2 will have the predicate8 property, fulfilling the goal for all problems in this domain. Since this strategy systematically applies actions based on the relations given in the problem, it does not require any search.
