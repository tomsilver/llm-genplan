This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," consists of various types, predicates, and actions. There are three main types: type2, type3, and type4, with type0 as their parent type. Type6 is another type derived from type0, while type5 is a standalone type.

There are six predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate2, predicate3, predicate6, and predicate7, each taking different types of objects as arguments.

Three actions (operators) are defined in this domain:
1. operator2: It takes three parameters (two of type2 and one of type3) and modifies the relationships between the objects based on the precondition.
2. operator0: This action takes three parameters (two of type2 and one of type6) and modifies the relationship between type3 and type6 objects based on the precondition.
3. operator1: This action has four parameters (two of type2, one of type3, and one of type4) and modifies the relationships between type3, type4, and type6 objects based on the precondition.

Two example problems, "my-problem-9" and "my-problem-5," are provided. They each have a set of objects, initial conditions, and goals. The goal of each problem is to reach a state where all type4 objects satisfy the predicate6 condition.
