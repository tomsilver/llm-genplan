A simple strategy to solve problems in this domain without using search is to apply the actions in a specific order. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. For each type2 object connected to a type3 object through predicate0, apply operator2 sequentially to move the type3 object along the chain of connected type2 objects until it reaches the last type2 object in the chain. Operator2 ensures that the type3 object only moves along connected type2 objects.

2. Once the type3 object is at the last type2 object in the chain, apply operator0 to associate the type3 object with a type6 object that also has a connection to the same type2 object through predicate0. This action creates a link between the type3 and type6 objects using predicate1.

3. Apply operator1 to each type4 object connected to the last type2 object in the chain. This action requires that the type4 object is also connected to the same type2 object as the type3 object, and the type3 object has a predicate1 connection to a type6 object with predicate7 satisfied. Operator1 will change the state of type4 objects to satisfy predicate6 and remove predicate7 from the connected type6 object.

By following this sequential strategy, the domain's problems can be solved without using search, ultimately achieving the goal where all type4 objects satisfy predicate6.
