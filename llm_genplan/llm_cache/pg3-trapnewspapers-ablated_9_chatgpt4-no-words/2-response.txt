The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

1. Use operator1 to transfer the predicate0 from object0 to other objects with predicate6. This can be done by applying the operator1 action with parameters (?v0 - object0, ?v3 - object with predicate6) until all objects with predicate6 have predicate0.

2. Apply the operator2 action to create a link between an object with predicate0 and predicate3, and an object with predicate8. This can be done by applying the operator2 action with parameters (?v2 - object with predicate8, ?v1 - object with predicate0 and predicate3). The effect of this action will remove predicate8 from the object and add predicate1.

3. Finally, use the operator0 action to remove the predicate1 and predicate9 from the objects and add predicate7 to the objects with predicate0. This can be done by applying the operator0 action with parameters (?v2 - object with predicate1, ?v1 - object with predicate0).

By following these steps, we can systematically solve any problem in this domain without requiring search, as it directly manipulates the predicates required to achieve the goal.
