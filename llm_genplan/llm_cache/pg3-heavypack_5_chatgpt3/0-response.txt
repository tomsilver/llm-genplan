The heavy-pack domain involves packing a set of objects into a box, subject to the constraint that heavier objects cannot be placed on top of lighter objects. The domain includes two actions: "pack-first" to pack the first object into an empty box, and "stack" to stack a previously packed object onto an unpacked object that can support its weight. The predicates used in the domain include "heavier" to compare the weight of two objects, "packed" to indicate if an object is packed in the box, "unpacked" to indicate if an object is not yet packed, and "nothing-above" to indicate if there are no other objects stacked on top of an object. The goal is to pack all objects in the box.
