Given this task:
(define (problem heavy-pack-prob (:domain heavy-pack)
  (:objects
    o162
    o692
    o841
  )
  (:init
    (box-empty)
    (heavier o162 o692)
    (heavier o162 o841)
    (heavier o841 o692)
    (unpacked o162)
    (unpacked o692)
    (unpacked o841)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (packed o162)
    (packed o692)
    (packed o841)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pack-first o841)', '(pack-first o692)', '(pack-first o162)'].
NOTE: (pack-first o692) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 1
(Set (box-empty) to true)
Fix the code.
