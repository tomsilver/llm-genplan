The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the actions in a specific order:

1. Apply the `operator0` action to an object with `predicate6`. This action will remove `predicate0` and `predicate6` from the object while adding `predicate4` and `predicate2`.

2. Next, apply the `operator1` action to the object from step 1 and another object with `predicate6`. This action requires `predicate4`, `predicate2`, and `predicate1` for the first object and `predicate6` for the second object. When executed, `operator1` will add `predicate4` and `predicate2` to the second object while removing `predicate2` from the first object and `predicate6` from the second object.

3. Repeat step 2 for all remaining objects with `predicate6`.

By following this strategy, you will achieve the goal state where all objects have `predicate4` without needing to perform a search.
