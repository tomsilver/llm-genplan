The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the action operators in a particular order to reach the desired goal state. 

1. First, analyze the goal state to identify the objects that need to be connected via predicate0.

2. For each object that needs to be connected via predicate0, perform the following steps:

    a. If the object is already connected to the correct object, skip this step.

    b. Use the "operator1" action to disconnect the object from its current connection. Since operator1 has preconditions predicate3, predicate6, predicate8, and predicate1, ensure that these predicates hold true for the involved objects. The effect of operator1 is to modify predicate0, predicate5, and predicate8, disconnecting the object from its current connection and making it available for a new connection.

    c. Use the "operator0" action to connect the object to the desired object as specified in the goal state. Since operator0 has preconditions predicate3, predicate6, predicate0, predicate1, and predicate5, ensure that these predicates hold true for the involved objects. The effect of operator0 is to modify predicate8, predicate0, and predicate5, connecting the object to the desired object.

3. Repeat steps 2a through 2c for all objects that need to be connected via predicate0 in the goal state.

By following this strategy, it is possible to solve all problems in this domain without the need for search.
