The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search consists of performing the actions in a specific order. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Use the "operator1" action to move the predicate0 to the desired object in the goal state. This action will remove the predicate0 from the current object and place it on a new object. Since there's only one object with predicate0 in the initial state, this action can be used iteratively until all goal objects have predicate0.

2. Apply the "operator2" action to pair each object from type0 (with predicate0 and predicate3) with an object from type1 (with predicate8). This action will remove predicate8 from the type1 object and add predicate1 to the same type1 object.

3. Finally, use the "operator0" action to remove predicate9 from the goal objects, and add predicate7 to them. This action pairs objects from type0 (with predicate0) and type1 (with predicate1), and modifies the predicates accordingly.

By following these steps, you can achieve the goal state for all problems in this domain without the need for search.
