The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to sequentially apply the actions in the following manner:

1. Apply the action operator0 to each object in the problem. This action will negate predicate0, apply predicate4 and predicate2 to the objects, and negate predicate6 for the objects.
2. For each object (let's call it A) for which predicate4 and predicate2 hold, find another object (let's call it B) that has predicate1 holding for the pair A and B, and predicate6 holding for object B. Apply the action operator1 to the pair of objects A and B. This action will negate predicate2 for object A, negate predicate6 for object B, and apply predicate4 and predicate2 to object B.

By following this strategy, you will eventually have predicate4 applied to all objects in the problem, which is the goal state for the domain.
