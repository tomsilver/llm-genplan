The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pick ball4 room0 gripper1)', '(move room0 room17)', '(drop ball4 room17 gripper1)', '(pick ball2 room17 gripper0)', '(move room17 room9)', '(drop ball2 room9 gripper0)', '(drop ball2 room9 gripper0)', '(move room9 room14)', '(pick ball5 room14 gripper0)', '(move room14 room6)', '(drop ball5 room6 gripper0)', '(drop ball5 room6 gripper0)', '(move room6 room12)', '(pick ball8 room12 gripper0)', '(move room12 room16)', '(drop ball8 room16 gripper0)'].
NOTE: (drop ball2 room9 gripper0) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 6
(Set (carry ball2 gripper0) to true)
Fix the code.
