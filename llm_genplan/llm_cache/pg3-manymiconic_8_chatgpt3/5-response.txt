To fix the error, we need to ensure that only hashable objects are used in the state tuple. In particular, we can't use sets, as they are not hashable. 

One solution would be to convert the sets to sorted tuples, which are hashable. We can do this by modifying the `in_elevator` and `waiting_passengers` variables as follows:

```
in_elevator = tuple(sorted(in_elevator))
waiting_passengers = tuple(sorted(waiting_passengers.items()))
```

With this modification, the code should run without error.
