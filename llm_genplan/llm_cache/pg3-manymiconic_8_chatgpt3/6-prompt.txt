The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 113
    To fix the error, we need to ensure that only hashable objects are used in the state tuple. In particular, we can't use sets, as they are not hashable. 
                                                                                                                     ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 113)

Fix the code.
