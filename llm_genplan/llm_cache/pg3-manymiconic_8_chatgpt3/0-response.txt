The Miconic domain is a simple elevator system domain that involves passengers and floors. The domain includes actions such as "board" for passengers to board the elevator, "depart" for passengers to depart from the elevator, "up" for the elevator to move up, and "down" for the elevator to move down. The domain also includes predicates such as "origin" and "destin" to specify the initial and final destinations of passengers and "lift-at" to indicate the current location of the elevator. The goal is to serve all passengers by transporting them to their respective destinations.
