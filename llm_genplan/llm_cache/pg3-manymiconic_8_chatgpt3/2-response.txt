The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to use a simple set of rules that allow the elevator to move up and down and serve passengers in a round-robin fashion. The rules are:

1. If there are passengers waiting at the current floor, pick them up.
2. If there are passengers in the elevator, drop them off at their destination floor.
3. If there are no passengers in the elevator or waiting at the current floor, move the elevator up or down to the next floor where passengers are waiting.

By following these rules, the elevator will serve all passengers and reach the goal state without needing to use search. The rules are based on a simple algorithm called "elevator control algorithm" (ECA) that is widely used in real-world elevator systems.
