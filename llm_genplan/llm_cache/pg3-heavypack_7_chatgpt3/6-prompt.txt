Given this task:
(define (problem heavy-pack-prob (:domain heavy-pack)
  (:objects
    o14
    o300
    o672
  )
  (:init
    (box-empty)
    (heavier o14 o300)
    (heavier o14 o672)
    (heavier o300 o672)
    (unpacked o14)
    (unpacked o300)
    (unpacked o672)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (packed o14)
    (packed o300)
    (packed o672)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 74
    The code failed to find a plan because the initial state does not satisfy the preconditions of the "pack-first" action, which requires the box to be empty. However, the initial state includes the "unpacked" predicate for all objects, which implies that the box is not empty.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Fix the code.
