Given this task:
(define (problem heavy-pack-prob (:domain heavy-pack)
  (:objects
    o14
    o300
    o672
  )
  (:init
    (box-empty)
    (heavier o14 o300)
    (heavier o14 o672)
    (heavier o300 o672)
    (unpacked o14)
    (unpacked o300)
    (unpacked o672)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (packed o14)
    (packed o300)
    (packed o672)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: [].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (packed o14) to true)
    and (Set (packed o300) to true)
    and (Set (packed o672) to true)
)
Fix the code.
