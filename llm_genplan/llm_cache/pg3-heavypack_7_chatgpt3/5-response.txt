The code failed to find a plan because the initial state does not satisfy the preconditions of the "pack-first" action, which requires the box to be empty. However, the initial state includes the "unpacked" predicate for all objects, which implies that the box is not empty.

Here is a corrected version of the initial state that satisfies the preconditions of the "pack-first" action:

```
(:init
    (box-empty)
    (heavier o14 o300)
    (heavier o14 o672)
    (heavier o300 o672)
    (unpacked o300)
    (unpacked o672)
    (unpacked o14)
)
```

In this version of the initial state, the "unpacked" predicate for the heaviest object, o672, is listed last. This ensures that the "pack-first" action can be used to pack o672 into the empty box first.

With this corrected initial state, the Python function should be able to find a plan that satisfies the goal.
