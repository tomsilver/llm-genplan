The heavy-pack domain is a planning problem involving packing items of different weights into a box. The domain includes predicates for whether an item is heavier than another, whether an item is packed or unpacked, whether nothing is above an item, and whether the box is empty. The two actions defined in the domain are "pack-first" for packing the first item into an empty box, and "stack" for stacking a packed item on top of another packed item as long as the bottom item is heavier and nothing is above it. The two example problems involve packing multiple items into an empty box, where the goal is to have all items packed in the box.
