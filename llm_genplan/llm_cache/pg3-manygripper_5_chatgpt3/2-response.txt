The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Gripper Strips domain without using search is to always select the closest gripper to the target ball and move the robot towards that gripper. Once the robot reaches the gripper, the gripper can pick up the ball and the robot can move towards the goal room. If there are multiple balls to pick up, the robot can repeat this process of moving towards the closest gripper and then towards the goal room until all the balls are picked up and placed in their goal positions. This strategy is based on the intuition that minimizing the distance between the robot and the closest gripper or goal ball at each step will result in an efficient solution.
