The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 31, in get_plan
    if target_ball is None or distance(robot_pos, ball_pos[ball]) < distance(robot_pos, ball_pos[target_ball]):
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 13, in distance
    x1, y1 = map(int, pos1[4:].split('_'))
    ^^^^^^
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)

Fix the code.
