The Gripper Strips domain involves a robot named Robby and two grippers that can pick up and drop balls in different rooms. The domain includes predicates for describing the location of the robot, balls, grippers, and the state of carrying a ball. The domain also includes three actions: move, pick, and drop, which allow the robot to move to different rooms, pick up a ball with a gripper, and drop a ball in a room. Two example problems are provided, each with a different initial state and goal for the robot to achieve.
