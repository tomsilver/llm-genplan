The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves taking advantage of the structure of the domain and the operators. The key is to apply the operators in a specific sequence to achieve the desired goal:

1. Determine the initial state and the goal state. Identify the relationships and properties that need to be changed to reach the goal state.

2. Apply `operator1` to change the `predicate1` property of the objects involved in the goal state. Make sure that the object to be connected in the goal state has the `predicate1` property.

3. Apply `operator2` to the objects identified in step 1. This will remove the `predicate0` relationship between the objects and create a `predicate3` relationship between the required objects. Also, the `predicate5` property will be removed from the respective object.

4. Apply `operator0` to the objects involved in the new `predicate3` relationships created in step 3. This will add the required `predicate0` relationship back between the objects and add the `predicate5` property to the respective object.

By following these steps, we can achieve the desired goal state without needing to perform a search. Note that this strategy assumes that the domain structure and operators remain consistent across all problems in the domain.
