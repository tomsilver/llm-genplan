The ferry domain is a simple planning domain that models a ferry moving cars between locations. The domain includes predicates for car, location, on, at, and empty-ferry, and actions for sail, board, and debark. The sail action moves the ferry from one location to another, the board action loads a car onto the ferry, and the debark action unloads a car from the ferry. The goal of the problems is to move the cars to specific locations using the ferry, with constraints on the locations and capacities of the ferry and the cars.
