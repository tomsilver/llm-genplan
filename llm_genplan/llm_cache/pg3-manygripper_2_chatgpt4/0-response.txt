The gripper-strips domain involves a robot named Robby that can move between rooms, pick up balls using grippers, and drop balls in different rooms. The domain is defined with various predicates such as room, ball, gripper, at-robby, at, free, and carry. There are three actions available for Robby: move, pick, and drop, each with their respective parameters, preconditions, and effects.

The example problems provided involve moving balls between rooms to achieve specific goals. In the problems, there are a set of balls, grippers, and rooms defined as objects. The initial state of the world is specified, including the locations of balls, the room where Robby is located, and the gripper states (free or carrying a ball). The goal is to move the balls to specific rooms according to the problem requirements.
