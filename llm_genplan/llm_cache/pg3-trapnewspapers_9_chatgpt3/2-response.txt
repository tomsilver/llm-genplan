The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Trap Newspapers domain without using search is to first unpack all the newspapers at the home base, and then deliver them directly to the locations that want them in a predetermined order. This strategy works because the domain is designed so that the agent can always reach each location that wants a newspaper without the need for backtracking or searching for an optimal path. Therefore, the agent can simply move from the home base to each location that wants a newspaper in a predetermined order, pick up a newspaper if available, and then deliver it before moving on to the next location. This approach guarantees a solution, but it may not always be optimal.
