The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to iterate through all the locations and newspapers, and for each location that wants a newspaper, pick up a newspaper from the home base (if there is one unpacked), move to the location, and deliver the newspaper. This process can be repeated until all locations that want newspapers are satisfied. Since the domain and problems do not include any obstacles or constraints that could prevent this strategy from working, it is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. This strategy is known as a "greedy" approach, where the robot always chooses the action that immediately satisfies the most pressing goal without considering future consequences or optimizing the overall plan.
