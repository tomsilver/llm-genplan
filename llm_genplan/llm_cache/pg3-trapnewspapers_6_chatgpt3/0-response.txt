The domain "trapnewspapers" describes a scenario where a robot must pick up newspapers from a home base and deliver them to various locations while avoiding traps. The domain includes predicates for the robot's location, whether it is at the home base, whether a location has been satisfied, whether a location wants a newspaper, and whether a location is safe. The robot can pick up a newspaper, move to a different location, and deliver a newspaper. The goal is for all locations that want a newspaper to be satisfied. Two example problems are provided, each with a different set of locations and newspapers to deliver.
