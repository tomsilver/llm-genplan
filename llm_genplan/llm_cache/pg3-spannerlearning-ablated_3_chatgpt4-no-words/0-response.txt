This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," involves different types of objects and actions. There are six types defined: type2, type0, type5, type3, type4, and type6. Type0 consists of type3, type4, and type6 as its subtypes.

The domain has six predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate2, predicate3, predicate6, and predicate7. These predicates establish relationships between different types of objects.

There are three actions in this domain: operator0, operator1, and operator2. Each action has its own set of parameters, preconditions, and effects. The actions are used to manipulate the relationships among objects, as defined by the predicates.

Two example problems, my-problem-9 and my-problem-5, are provided. Both problems involve a set of objects, initial conditions (relationships between objects), and a goal state. The goal state is defined as a set of conditions that must be met, usually involving predicate6. The objective of these problems is to find a sequence of actions that satisfy the goal conditions.
