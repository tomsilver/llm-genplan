The "spanner" domain describes a scenario where a man named "bob" is in possession of multiple spanners and needs to use them to tighten three nuts located at a gate. The domain defines several predicates including "at" which relates an object to a location, "carrying" which relates a man to a spanner, and "tightened" which indicates that a nut has been tightened. The actions in the domain include "walk" which allows the man to move from one location to another, "pickup_spanner" which allows the man to pick up a spanner located at his current location, and "tighten_nut" which allows the man to tighten a nut at his current location using a spanner he is carrying. The two example problems provided involve the same setup but with different initial locations for the spanners.
