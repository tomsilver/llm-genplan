The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves performing a sequence of actions in the following order:

1. Apply the "operator2" action on each pair of objects (?v2 - type1 and ?v1 - type0) that satisfy the preconditions (predicate0 and predicate3 for ?v1, and predicate8 for ?v2). This will change the state of the type1 objects from predicate8 to predicate1.

2. Apply the "operator0" action on each pair of objects (?v2 - type1 and ?v1 - type0) that satisfy the preconditions (predicate0 for ?v1, and predicate1 for ?v2). This will remove predicate1 from the type1 objects and predicate9 from the type0 objects, adding predicate7 to the type0 objects.

3. If any type0 objects still have predicate0 and predicate6, apply the "operator1" action on pairs of type0 objects (?v0 - type0 and ?v3 - type0) that satisfy the preconditions (predicate0 and predicate6 for ?v0). This will transfer predicate0 status from one type0 object to another. Repeat this step until all the goal conditions are met.

By following this strategy, you can achieve the desired goal conditions without using search, as it ensures that the type0 objects required by the goal will have predicate7.
