This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," consists of two types: type0 and type1. There are seven predicates defined in the domain, with predicates 0-6 applying to objects of type0 and predicates 8 and 1 applying to objects of type1.

The domain includes three actions: operator0, operator1, and operator2. Operator2 takes two parameters (?v2 - type1 and ?v1 - type0) and changes the state of a type1 object from predicate8 to predicate1, provided that the type0 object has predicates 0 and 3. Operator1 takes two parameters (?v0 - type0 and ?v3 - type0) and transfers the predicate0 status from one type0 object to another, given that the initial object has predicates 0 and 6. Operator0 takes two parameters (?v2 - type1 and ?v1 - type0) and removes predicate1 from the type1 object and predicate9 from the type0 object, adding predicate7 to the type0 object, provided that the type0 object has predicate0 and the type1 object has predicate1.

There are two example problems provided. In both problems, the goal is to achieve the predicate7 state for certain type0 objects. The problems have different sets of initial conditions and objects but share the same underlying domain structure.
