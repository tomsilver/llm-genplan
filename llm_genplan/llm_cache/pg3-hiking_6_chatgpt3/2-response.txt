The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to first identify the trail that leads from the initial location to the goal location, and then move the hiker along that trail. Since the hiker can only move on the trail and cannot traverse water, the trail provides a safe path for the hiker to reach the goal. Additionally, since the hiker can climb hills but not traverse water, the hiker will always take the shortest path by climbing over any hills that are in the way. Therefore, by following the trail and climbing any hills that block the way, the hiker can reach the goal location without the need for search.
