The hiking domain is a simple planning problem domain that models a hiker's movement through a terrain consisting of locations that may be hills, water, or plain ground. The hiker moves between adjacent locations on trails and can walk on plain ground or climb hills but cannot traverse water. The domain includes predicates to describe the location of the hiker, the type of location, and their adjacency. The goal is to reach a specified destination location from an initial location.
