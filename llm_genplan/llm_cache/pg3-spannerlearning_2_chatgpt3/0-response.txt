The spanner domain is a simple planning domain in which a man named Bob needs to tighten three nuts using three spanners. Bob can walk between locations connected by links, and he can pick up spanners and carry them around. Nuts are initially loose and can only be tightened once. The goal of each problem is to tighten all three nuts. The domain has four types of objects: locations, men, nuts, and spanners, and five predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, and tightened/loose.
