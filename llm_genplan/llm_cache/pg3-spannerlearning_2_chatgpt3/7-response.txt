There could be various reasons why the code is failing to satisfy the goal. Here are a few things to check:

1. Check if the problem is solvable: Make sure that the problem is actually solvable. There could be cases where the problem is not solvable given the initial state and actions.

2. Check the actions and preconditions: Make sure that the actions in the plan are correct and the preconditions for each action are satisfied before executing it. 

3. Check the objects and types: Make sure that the objects are of the correct types and the types are defined correctly in the domain.

4. Check the predicates: Make sure that the predicates are defined correctly in the domain and the initial state and goal state are defined using the predicates correctly.

5. Check the implementation: Make sure that the implementation of the planner is correct and there are no bugs in the code.

It is difficult to provide more specific advice without seeing the code, but these are some general things to check when a planner fails to satisfy a goal.
