Yes, there is a simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search, which is as follows:

1. Pick up a spanner that is both at Bob's current location and usable.
2. Walk to the location of a nut that is loose and at the same location as the spanner.
3. Tighten the nut with the spanner.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all nuts have been tightened.

This strategy is guaranteed to work for any problem in the spanner domain, as long as there is at least one usable spanner at the same location as each loose nut. The strategy works by systematically picking up usable spanners and tightening loose nuts that are at the same location. Since each nut can only be tightened once, the strategy will eventually lead to all nuts being tightened, which is the goal of each problem in this domain.
