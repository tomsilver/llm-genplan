A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search would involve following a sequence of actions:

1. For each object of type6 that has predicate7, perform the 'operator0' action to establish a predicate1 relationship between an object of type3 and the object of type6. This will also remove the predicate0 relationship between the object of type6 and the object of type2.

2. Next, for each object of type4 that has predicate3, perform the 'operator1' action, using the established predicate1 relationship from step 1. This will remove predicate3 and predicate7 for the respective objects of type4 and type6, and establish predicate6 for the objects of type4.

3. If there are any objects of type2 with a predicate0 relationship with an object of type3, but no predicate2 relationship with any other objects of type2, perform the 'operator2' action to update the predicate0 relationship with another object of type2.

By following this strategy, you will update the predicates as required to reach the goal state, where predicate6 is established for the specified objects of type4. This approach may not be optimal, but it guarantees a solution to the given problem instances in this domain without resorting to search.
