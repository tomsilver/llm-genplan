I apologize for the confusion, as it seems I provided you with the incorrect code in my previous response. Here is the corrected version of the code to address the SyntaxError issue:

```lisp
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)
  (:objects
    gate - location
    location1 - location
    location2 - location
    location3 - location
    location4 - location
    shed - location
    bob - man
    nut1 - nut
    nut2 - nut
    nut3 - nut
    spanner1 - spanner
    spanner2 - spanner
    spanner3 - spanner
    spanner4 - spanner
    spanner5 - spanner
  )
  (:init
    (at bob shed)
    (at nut1 gate)
    (at nut2 gate)
    (at nut3 gate)
    (at spanner1 location2)
    (at spanner2 location2)
    (at spanner3 location3)
    (at spanner4 location4)
    (at spanner5 location1)
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
    (link location3 location4)
    (link location4 gate)
    (link shed location1)
    (loose nut1)
    (loose nut2)
    (loose nut3)
    (useable spanner1)
    (useable spanner2)
    (useable spanner3)
    (useable spanner4)
    (useable spanner5)
  )
  (:goal (and
    (tightened nut1)
    (tightened nut2)
    (tightened nut3)
  )
)
```

This code should not have the SyntaxError issue, as it uses Lisp syntax and is a well-formed task definition.
