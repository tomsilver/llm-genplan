--------------------------
It seems the KeyError occurs because 'spanner3' is missing from the spanner_distances dictionary. The issue might be caused by the initialization of the spanner_locations dictionary. Let's update the code to handle this case properly by using the spanner's object name as the key in the spanner_locations dictionary.

Here's the updated code:

python
Copy code
from itertools import permutations

def get_plan(objects, init, goal):
    # Helper function to find the shortest distance between two locations
    def shortest_path(links, start, end, visited=None):
        if visited is None:
            visited = set()
        visited.add(start)
        if start == end:
            return 0
        min_distance = float("inf")
        for link in links:
            if start in link and not any(l in visited for l in link):
                next_loc = link[1] if link[0] == start else link[0]
                distance = shortest_path(links, next_loc, end, visited) + 1
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
        visited.remove(start)
        return min_distance

    # Extract data from objects, init, and goal
    locations = [o for o in objects if o[1] == "location"]
    spanners = [o for o in objects if o[1] == "spanner"]
    nuts = [o for o in objects if o[1] == "nut"]
    links = [i for i in init if i[0] == "link"]
    loose_nuts = [g for g in goal if g[0] == "tightened"]

    # Find the initial location of Bob, spanners, and nuts
    bob_location = next(i[1] for i in init if i[0] == "at" and i[1].startswith("bob"))
    spanner_locations = {s[0]: next(i[1] for i in init if i[0] == "at" and i[1] == s[0]) for s in spanners}
    nut_locations = {n[0]: n[1] for n in init if n[0].startswith("nut")}

    # Calculate the shortest path to each spanner and nut from Bob's location
    spanner_distances = {s: shortest_path(links, bob_location, loc) for s, loc in spanner_locations.items()}
    nut_distances = {n: shortest_path(links, bob_location, loc) for n, loc in nut_locations.items()}

    # Sort the spanners by the distance from Bob
    sorted_spanners = sorted(spanners, key=lambda s: spanner_distances[s[0]])

    # Calculate the total distance Bob needs to travel for each spanner
    min_distance = float("inf")
    best_plan = []
    for spanner in sorted_spanners:
        # Calculate the distance to pick up the spanner and tighten all the nuts
        plan = []
        current_location = bob_location
        distance = spanner_distances[spanner[0]]
        plan.append(f"(walk {current_location} {spanner_locations[spanner[0]]} bob)")
        current_location = spanner_locations[spanner[0]]
        plan.append(f"(pickup_spanner {current_location} {spanner[0]} bob)")
        for nut in loose_nuts:
            distance += shortest_path(links, current_location, nut_locations[nut[1]])
            plan.append(f"(walk {current_location} {nut_locations[nut[1]]} bob)")
            current_location = nut_locations[nut[1]]
