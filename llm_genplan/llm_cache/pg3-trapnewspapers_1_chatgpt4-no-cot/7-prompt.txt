    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(pick-up paper-3 loc-0)', '(pick-up paper-2 loc-0)', '(pick-up paper-0 loc-0)', '(pick-up paper-1 loc-0)', '(move loc-0 loc-8)', '(deliver paper-2 loc-8)', '(move loc-8 loc-2)', '(deliver paper-0 loc-2)', '(move loc-2 loc-1)', '(deliver paper-1 loc-1)', '(move loc-1 loc-7)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Set (satisfied loc-7) to true)
Fix the code.
