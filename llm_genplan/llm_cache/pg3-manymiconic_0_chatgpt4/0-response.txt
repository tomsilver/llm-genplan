The Miconic domain represents a simplified elevator problem, where the goal is to transport passengers between floors in a building. The domain has two types of objects: passengers and floors. There are several predicates to define the origin and destination floors for passengers, the relative positions of floors (above), the status of passengers as boarded or served, and the current location of the elevator (lift).

There are four possible actions in this domain:

    board: A passenger boards the elevator when it is at their origin floor.
    depart: A passenger departs the elevator when it is at their destination floor, and they become served.
    up: The elevator moves up to a floor above its current location.
    down: The elevator moves down to a floor below its current location.

The example problem provided defines a specific instance of the Miconic domain, with a building having eight floors (f0_b0 to f7_b0) and four passengers (p0_b0 to p3_b0). The initial state specifies the relative positions of floors, origin and destination floors for each passenger, and the starting location of the elevator. The goal is to serve all passengers by transporting them to their respective destination floors.
