A simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is the "Sweep" method. This method involves moving the elevator from the lowest floor to the highest floor, stopping at each floor along the way, and then back down from the highest floor to the lowest floor, also stopping at each floor.

Here's how the Sweep strategy works:

    Start at the lowest floor.
    Move the elevator up one floor at a time.
    a. At each floor, if there's a passenger with the origin floor same as the current floor, let them board the elevator.
    b. If there's a boarded passenger with the destination floor same as the current floor, let them depart the elevator.
    Once the elevator reaches the highest floor, reverse the direction and move down one floor at a time, repeating the boarding and departing process.
    Continue until the elevator reaches the lowest floor again.

This strategy ensures that all passengers are served by the time the elevator reaches the lowest floor again. Although it may not be the most efficient solution in terms of the number of actions performed, it guarantees that all passengers are transported to their destination floors without the need for search algorithms.
