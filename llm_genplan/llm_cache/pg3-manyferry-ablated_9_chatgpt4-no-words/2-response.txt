A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be performed through the following steps:

1. First, identify the objects involved in the goal state connections. For each of these connections, find the current connections between objects in the initial state.

2. For each connection in the initial state that does not match the desired goal state, apply operator0 to disconnect the objects. Make sure that predicate5 holds true before applying operator0. If predicate5 is false, use operator1 to establish an arbitrary connection between two disconnected objects, making predicate5 true again.

3. After disconnecting the objects, check if the new connection in the goal state involves an object with predicate1. If not, use operator2 to transfer the predicate1 property between the connected objects (predicate7) that have predicate6 property until the desired object has predicate1.

4. Finally, apply operator1 to connect the objects as specified in the goal state. Ensure that predicate5 is true before applying operator1. If predicate5 is false, use operator0 to disconnect an arbitrary pair of connected objects, making predicate5 true again.

By sequentially applying these steps, you can achieve the goal state without performing search, as this strategy directly manipulates the connections and properties to match the desired outcome.
