The code returned this plan: ['move room10 room15', 'pick ball2 room10 gripper1', 'move room10 room15', 'drop ball2 room15 gripper1']
However, the action move room10 room15 is invalid at step 0.
NOTE: the valid operators are: (drop ?obj ?room ?gripper) (move ?from ?to) (pick ?obj ?room ?gripper).
Fix the code.
