The strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search involves sequentially applying the action operators in a specific order to achieve the goal state. The following is a step-by-step strategy:

1. Apply the `operator2` action to move `object0` to different objects of type2, following the chain of connections defined by the `predicate2` relationship. By doing this, you can establish a `predicate0` relationship between `object0` and every object of type2.

2. Apply the `operator0` action on the objects of type6 that have a `predicate0` relationship with an object of type2, creating a `predicate1` relationship between `object0` and each object of type6.

3. Finally, apply the `operator1` action using objects of type4 that have a `predicate0` relationship with an object of type2, and objects of type6 that have a `predicate1` relationship with `object0`. This will remove the `predicate3` and `predicate7` relationships and create a `predicate6` relationship for each object of type4, thus achieving the goal state.

By following this strategy, the operators are applied in a deterministic manner, avoiding the need for search algorithms to find a solution.
