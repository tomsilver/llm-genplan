The ferry domain is a planning problem involving a ferry that transports cars between different locations. The domain consists of three main actions: sail, board, and debark.

The sail action allows the ferry to move from one location to another, given that the destination and departure locations are different and the ferry is at the departure location.
The board action enables a car to be loaded onto the ferry, provided that the car, the ferry, and the location are all at the same place, and the ferry is empty.
The debark action allows a car to be unloaded from the ferry at a specific location, given that the car is on the ferry and the ferry is at the desired location.
The example problems involve different initial states of cars and ferry locations, as well as various goal states specifying the desired locations for each car. The objective is to find a sequence of actions (sailing, boarding, and debarking) to transport the cars to their target locations using the ferry.
