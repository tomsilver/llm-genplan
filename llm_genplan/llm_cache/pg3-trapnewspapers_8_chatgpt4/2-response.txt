The simple strategy for solving all problems in the trapnewspapers domain without using search involves a systematic approach to picking up, moving, and delivering newspapers. This strategy can be applied to any problem in this domain:

Start at the home base location (the location marked with the predicate "ishomebase").
Pick up a newspaper that is unpacked at the home base (using the "pick-up" action).
Move to a safe location where a newspaper is wanted (using the "move" action).
Deliver the newspaper to that location (using the "deliver" action), satisfying its need for a newspaper.
Repeat steps 2-4 until all locations wanting newspapers have been satisfied.
Return to the home base location (optional).
By following this straightforward strategy, you can efficiently solve any problem in the trapnewspapers domain without needing to search for an optimal solution. This approach works well because the domain is structured in a way that allows for a clear sequence of actions to achieve the goal, making it unnecessary to explore alternative plans.
