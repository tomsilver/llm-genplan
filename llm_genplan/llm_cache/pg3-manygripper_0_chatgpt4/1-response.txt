The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be described as follows:

    Identify the target rooms and the balls that need to be moved to those rooms, based on the goal state.
    For each ball that needs to be moved, follow these steps:
    a. Move Robby to the room containing the ball.
    b. Pick up the ball using a free gripper.
    c. Move Robby to the target room where the ball must be placed.
    d. Drop the ball in the target room, freeing the gripper.
    Repeat the process for each ball until all the goal conditions are met.

This strategy relies on the problem statement and goal state, and it does not require search or planning algorithms. Instead, it follows a straightforward sequence of actions based on the given information.
