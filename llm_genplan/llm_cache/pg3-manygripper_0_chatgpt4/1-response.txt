A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a systematic sequence of actions that guarantee reaching the goal state. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

    Identify the goal state, i.e., the required positions of the balls in specific rooms.
    Move Robby to the room containing the first target ball.
    Pick up the target ball using a free gripper.
    Move Robby to the destination room specified in the goal state for the picked-up ball.
    Drop the ball in the destination room.
    Repeat steps 2 to 5 for all target balls specified in the goal state.

By following this simple strategy, Robby will move each target ball to its required position one by one, ensuring the problem is solved without needing to perform any search. This approach assumes that the problem is well-defined and the initial and goal states are compatible with the available actions.
