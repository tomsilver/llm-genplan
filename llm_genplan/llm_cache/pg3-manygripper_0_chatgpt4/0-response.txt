The "gripper-strips" domain represents a planning problem where a robot named Robby has to manipulate and move objects (balls) between different rooms. The domain includes several predicates such as room, ball, gripper, at-robby, at, free, and carry to describe the state of the world. There are three main actions: move, pick, and drop. The move action allows Robby to move between rooms, the pick action enables it to pick up a ball in a room using a gripper, and the drop action allows Robby to drop a ball in a room. Example problems in this domain consist of specific objects, initial states, and goals that need to be achieved by Robby. The goals typically involve moving balls to specific rooms by utilizing the available actions.
