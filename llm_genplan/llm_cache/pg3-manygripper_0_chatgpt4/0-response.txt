The Gripper-Strips domain involves a robot named Robby with multiple grippers, rooms, and balls. The domain consists of three main actions: move, pick, and drop. The move action allows Robby to move between rooms, while the pick action lets Robby pick up a ball in a room using a free gripper, and the drop action allows Robby to drop a ball in a room, freeing the gripper. The example problem, manygripper, includes several rooms, balls, and two grippers. The initial state places Robby, the balls, and the grippers in different rooms, with some grippers being free. The goal state requires Robby to move specific balls to designated rooms.
