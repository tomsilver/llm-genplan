While it is possible that some Sokoban-sequential problems could have simple solutions, there isn't a universal strategy that can solve all problems in this domain without using search. Sokoban puzzles can be quite complex, and their solutions often involve intricate sequences of moves and pushes.

In general, a problem-solving strategy for Sokoban-sequential puzzles may involve several steps, such as:

    Identifying the goals and non-goals.
    Analyzing the puzzle layout and the initial positions of the player and stones.
    Planning a sequence of moves and pushes for the player to reach each goal location while considering the constraints of the puzzle, such as walls and other obstacles.
    Executing the planned sequence of actions to push the stones onto the goal locations.

However, these steps typically involve searching through the state space of the problem, evaluating different possible sequences of moves and pushes, and backtracking when necessary. As a result, a search-based approach is usually required to solve Sokoban-sequential puzzles effectively.
