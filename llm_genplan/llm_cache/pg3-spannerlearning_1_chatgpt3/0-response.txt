The "spanner" domain is a planning problem in which a man named "Bob" is trying to tighten nuts using spanners in different locations connected by links. The domain has four types of objects: locations, men, nuts, and spanners. The domain includes actions such as "walk" for moving between locations, "pickup_spanner" for picking up a spanner at a location, and "tighten_nut" for tightening a loose nut with a carried spanner. The goal is to tighten all the nuts in the given locations using the available spanners. The problem instances specify the initial state of the objects and the desired goal state.
