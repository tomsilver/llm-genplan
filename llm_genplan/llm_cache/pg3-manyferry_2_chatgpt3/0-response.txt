The "ferry" domain is a simple domain that models a ferry transporting cars between different locations. The domain includes predicates for cars, locations, and the state of the ferry, and actions for the ferry sailing, cars boarding the ferry, and cars debarking from the ferry. The domain is used to solve two example problems where cars need to be transported from their initial locations to their respective goal locations using the ferry.
