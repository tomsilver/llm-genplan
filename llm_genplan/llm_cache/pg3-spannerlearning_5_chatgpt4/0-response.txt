The "spanner" domain is a problem-solving scenario where a man named Bob needs to tighten loose nuts using various spanners at different locations. The domain includes several object types, such as location, man, nut, and spanner. There are also several predicates to describe the state of the objects, such as their location, whether a man is carrying a spanner, the usability of a spanner, and the tightness of a nut.

There are three main actions in this domain: walk, pickup_spanner, and tighten_nut. The walk action allows Bob to move from one location to another if there is a link between the locations. The pickup_spanner action enables Bob to pick up a spanner at his current location. The tighten_nut action allows Bob to tighten a loose nut at his current location if he is carrying a usable spanner.

The example problems provided involve Bob starting at a shed and needing to tighten nuts at a gate. The nuts and spanners are placed at different locations, and Bob must navigate the area, pick up the spanners, and tighten the nuts to achieve the goal. The problems differ in the layout of the locations, the number of nuts to be tightened, and the spanners' positions.
