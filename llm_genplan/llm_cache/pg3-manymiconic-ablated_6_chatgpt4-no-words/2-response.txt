The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the actions in a specific order while following their preconditions. The actions can be sequenced as follows:

1. Apply "operator0" action for each type2 object:
   - Find a pair of type0 and type2 objects such that the precondition (predicate6 ?v0) and (predicate7 ?v6 ?v0) hold.
   - Apply the action, which results in (predicate2 ?v6) for the type2 object.

2. Apply "operator1" action for each type2 object:
   - Find a pair of type0 and type2 objects such that the preconditions (predicate6 ?v0), (predicate4 ?v6 ?v0), and (predicate2 ?v6) hold.
   - Apply the action, which results in the removal of (predicate2 ?v6) and the addition of (predicate8 ?v6) for the type2 object.

3. If needed, use "operator3" or "operator2" actions to move the (predicate6 ?v1) condition from one type0 object to another, ensuring that the preconditions for "operator0" and "operator1" are met.

By sequentially applying the actions as described above, you can satisfy the goal conditions of having (predicate8 ?v6) for all type2 objects without using search.
