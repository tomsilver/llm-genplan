The simple strategy to solve problems in this domain without using search relies on understanding the actions and their effects. Here's the strategy:

1. Identify the goal predicates in the problem that involve the `predicate0` relationship.

2. For each goal predicate `(predicate0 ?v1 ?v4)`, perform the following steps:
   a. Find the corresponding `predicate8 ?v1` and `predicate1 ?v4` in the initial state, if they exist.
   b. If `predicate8 ?v1` exists, apply the `operator1` action with the parameters `(?v1, ?v4)` to remove `predicate8 ?v1` and establish `(predicate0 ?v1 ?v4)`.
   c. If `predicate1 ?v4` does not exist, find the object ?v5 connected to ?v4 via `predicate7` in the initial state, such that `predicate1 ?v5` exists. Apply the `operator2` action with parameters `(?v5, ?v4)` to transfer the `predicate1` property from ?v5 to ?v4.

3. After transferring the `predicate1` property to the desired objects, apply the `operator0` action with parameters `(?v1, ?v4)` for each goal predicate `(predicate0 ?v1 ?v4)`.

This strategy works because it exploits the preconditions and effects of the operators to directly manipulate the relationships between objects to reach the goal state. The actions are designed in a way that allows for a deterministic solution without the need for search.
