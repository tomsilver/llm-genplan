This PDDL domain represents a system involving three different types of objects (type0, type1, and type2) and various predicates and actions involving these objects. The domain contains four operators (operator0, operator1, operator2, and operator3) that define actions with specific preconditions and effects. The actions involve predicates that denote relationships between objects of different types.

The example problems provided describe specific scenarios with different objects and their initial states. The goal in each problem is to achieve a certain configuration of the objects by applying the actions from the domain. In both example problems, the goal is to achieve a state where all type2 objects have the predicate8 applied to them. The initial states of the objects and their relationships differ between the two problems.
