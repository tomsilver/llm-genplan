The strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search consists of following these steps:

1. For each type2 object, find a type0 object that is connected to it via predicate7 or predicate4.
2. Perform the 'operator0' action on the type2 and type0 objects that are connected through predicate7. This will apply the predicate2 to the type2 object.
3. Perform the 'operator1' action on the type2 and type0 objects that are connected through predicate4 and have predicate2 applied. This will remove predicate2 from the type2 object and apply predicate8 to it.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all type2 objects in the problem.

By following this strategy, you will systematically apply predicate8 to all type2 objects, achieving the goal state in all problems in this domain.
