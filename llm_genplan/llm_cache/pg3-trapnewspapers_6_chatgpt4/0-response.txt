The "trapnewspapers" domain is a planning problem related to delivering newspapers to various locations. There are two types of objects: locations (loc) and papers (paper). The predicates define the properties of these objects, such as whether a location is a home base, if a paper is unpacked or being carried, or if a location is satisfied with a delivered newspaper.

There are three actions in this domain: pick-up, move, and deliver. The pick-up action allows picking up a paper from the home base, the move action allows moving between safe locations, and the deliver action allows delivering a paper to a location that wants a newspaper. The goal is to satisfy all locations that want a newspaper by delivering the appropriate papers. The example problems provided involve different configurations of locations, papers, and their properties.
