The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is as follows:

Bob should start at the shed and visit all the locations in a systematic order, either following the links or using a depth-first or breadth-first traversal.
At each location, if there is a spanner, Bob should pick it up.
When Bob reaches the gate location, he should try to use each carried spanner to tighten the loose nuts.
a. If a spanner is useable and there is a loose nut at the gate, use the spanner to tighten the nut.
b. If a nut is tightened, mark it as tightened and the spanner as not useable.
Repeat step 3 until all nuts are tightened.
The goal is achieved when all nuts are tightened.
By following this strategy, Bob can systematically tighten all the nuts without the need for search, as he will eventually visit all the locations and collect all the available spanners.
