This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," involves two types of objects: type0 and type2, which are both subtypes of type1. The domain includes five predicates (predicate0 to predicate8) and four actions (operator0 to operator3).

The actions in the domain have the following effects:
1. operator0: When applied, it makes predicate2 true for the type2 object involved.
2. operator1: When applied, it makes predicate8 true for the type2 object involved and makes predicate2 false for the same object.
3. operator3: When applied, it makes predicate6 true for the second type0 object and false for the first type0 object.
4. operator2: When applied, it has the same effect as operator3.

The example problems provided consist of a list of objects (type0 and type2), an initial state with predicates set for specific objects, and a goal state in which predicate8 must be true for certain type2 objects. The problems involve achieving the goal state by applying actions from the domain to the objects in a specific sequence.
