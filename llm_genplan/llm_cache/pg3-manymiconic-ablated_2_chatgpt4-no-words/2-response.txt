The simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the actions in a specific order:

1. Apply operator0 to all type2 objects (?v6) and their corresponding type0 objects (?v0) where (predicate7 ?v6 ?v0) and (predicate6 ?v0) are true. This will make predicate2 true for all these type2 objects.
2. Apply operator1 to all type2 objects (?v6) and their corresponding type0 objects (?v0) where (predicate4 ?v6 ?v0), (predicate6 ?v0), and (predicate2 ?v6) are true. This will make predicate8 true for all these type2 objects and make predicate2 false for them.
3. If there are still type0 objects with predicate6 true, find a pair of type0 objects (?v1, ?v2) such that (predicate0 ?v1 ?v2) is true and apply operator3 (or operator2, as they have the same effect). This will transfer the predicate6 from ?v1 to ?v2.
4. Repeat step 3 until the goal is reached, or no more valid pairs can be found.

By applying the actions in this sequence, the goal state can be achieved without the need for extensive search.
