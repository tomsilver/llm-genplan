The "movie-strips" domain models a scenario where people watch a movie and get snacks during the movie. The domain includes predicates for the state of the movie counter, whether the movie has been rewound or not, and whether various snacks have been obtained or not. The actions in the domain include rewinding the movie, resetting the counter, and getting various snacks. The two example problems involve obtaining chips, dip, pop, cheese, and crackers before watching a movie, and the goal is to have the movie rewound, the counter at zero, and all snacks obtained.
