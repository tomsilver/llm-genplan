The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to simply apply the actions in a fixed order until the goal is achieved.

The fixed order is as follows:

    Get chips
    Get dip
    Get pop
    Get cheese
    Get crackers
    Rewind the movie if the counter is not at two hours
    Rewind the movie if the counter is at two hours
    Reset the counter to zero

This strategy works because the order of obtaining snacks and rewinding the movie does not affect the final state of the world as long as all the snacks are obtained before the movie is rewound. Also, rewinding the movie at two hours ensures that it is always rewound to the beginning, regardless of the initial state of the counter. Finally, resetting the counter to zero ensures that the movie can be rewound again if desired.
