The "trapnewspapers" domain is a simple planning problem about a newspaper delivery system. The domain involves the delivery of newspapers to different locations by a delivery agent who can move between locations and pick up and deliver newspapers. The delivery agent has to pick up newspapers from a homebase and deliver them to locations where they are wanted. The domain defines predicates for the agent's location, whether a location is the homebase or safe, whether a location wants a newspaper, and whether a location has been satisfied. There are also predicates for whether a newspaper has been unpacked or is being carried by the agent. The domain includes actions for picking up a newspaper, moving to a new location, and delivering a newspaper. Two example problems are defined in the domain, where the agent has to satisfy the desires of specific locations by delivering newspapers to them.
