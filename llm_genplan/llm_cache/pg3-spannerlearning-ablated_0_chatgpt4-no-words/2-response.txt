To solve all problems in this domain without using search, you can follow this simple strategy:

1. Identify the objects of type4 that need to be connected with predicate6, as specified in the goal. Let's call these objects T4_objects.

2. For each object t4 in T4_objects:
   a. Find the corresponding type2 object (t2) connected to t4 via predicate0.
   b. Identify the type3 object (t3) connected to t2 via predicate0.
   c. Find the type6 object (t6) connected to t2 via predicate0, and ensure that it's also connected to t3 via predicate1 by applying the operator0 action if necessary.
   d. Make sure that the predicate7 holds for the type6 object (t6) by checking the initial state or applying previous actions if needed.
   e. Apply the operator1 action using t2, t3, t4, and t6 as parameters. This will result in predicate6 holding for the type4 object (t4) while removing predicate3 for t4 and predicate7 for t6.

By following this strategy, you can achieve the goal of connecting all objects of type4 with predicate6 without using search. This is possible because the domain structure and actions are designed in such a way that allows for direct manipulation of the predicates to achieve the desired goal state.
