The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be outlined as follows:

1. For each goal condition involving predicate0 (e.g., (predicate0 objectX objectY)), check if the precondition is already satisfied in the initial state. If it is, no action is needed.

2. If the precondition is not met, find the current object associated with objectX using predicate0 in the initial state (e.g., (predicate0 objectX objectZ)).

3. Use operator1 to transfer the predicate1 property from the current object (objectZ) to the target object (objectY) by applying (operator1 objectZ objectY).

4. Find an available object with predicate5 and predicate6 properties (e.g., objectW). If there is no such object, apply operator0 to free up an object by disconnecting its association with another object.

5. Apply operator2 to associate objectX with objectY and transfer the required property from objectW by applying (operator2 objectX objectY objectW).

By following these steps, you can achieve the goal conditions without the need for search.
