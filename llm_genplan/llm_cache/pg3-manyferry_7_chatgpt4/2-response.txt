A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be as follows:

For each car that needs to be moved, perform the following steps:
a. Sail the ferry to the location of the car.
b. Board the car onto the ferry.
c. Sail the ferry to the desired destination of the car.
d. Debark the car at the destination.
This strategy works because the ferry can only carry one car at a time and must be empty to pick up another car. By focusing on one car at a time and moving it to its destination, we can avoid complicated search algorithms and ensure that each car reaches its destination.
