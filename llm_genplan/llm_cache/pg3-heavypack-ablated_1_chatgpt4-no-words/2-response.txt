A simple strategy to solve problems in this domain without using search can be executed as follows:

1. Apply the action "operator0" to an object with "predicate6" true. This will negate "predicate0," and add "predicate4" and "predicate2" to the selected object, while negating its "predicate6."

2. Next, iteratively apply the action "operator1" to pairs of objects where the first object (?v0) has "predicate4" and "predicate2" true, and the second object (?v4) has "predicate6" true and shares a "predicate1" relationship with the first object. This action will transfer the "predicate4" and "predicate2" from the first object to the second, while negating "predicate6" for the second object.

3. Repeat step 2 until all objects have "predicate4" true and "predicate6" false.

This strategy relies on the fact that the "operator0" action is used to initialize one object with "predicate4" and "predicate2," and then "operator1" is used to propagate these predicates to other objects while maintaining the relationships specified by "predicate1." By iteratively applying "operator1," we can achieve the goal state of having all objects with "predicate4" true.
