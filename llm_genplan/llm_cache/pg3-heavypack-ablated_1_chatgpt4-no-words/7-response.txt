I apologize for the confusion. The previously provided code is a simple strategy that may not work for all problem instances. It does not guarantee that a solution will be found for every problem. Since the problem you provided does not fit the simple strategy, it returns an empty plan indicating that the goal is not satisfied.

In this case, you might want to consider using a search algorithm, like A* or depth-first search, to find a valid plan for the given problem.
