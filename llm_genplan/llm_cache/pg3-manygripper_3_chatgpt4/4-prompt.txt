The code returned this plan: ['move room0 room13', 'pick ball6 room13 gripper1', 'move room13 room0', 'drop ball6 room0 gripper1', 'move room0 room5', 'pick ball5 room5 gripper1', 'move room5 room6', 'drop ball5 room6 gripper1', 'move room6 room9', 'pick ball0 room9 gripper1', 'move room9 room7', 'drop ball0 room7 gripper1', 'move room7 room3', 'pick ball1 room3 gripper1', 'move room3 room12', 'drop ball1 room12 gripper1', 'move room12 room0', 'pick ball4 room0 gripper1', 'move room0 room4', 'drop ball4 room4 gripper1']
However, the action move room0 room13 is invalid at step 0.
NOTE: the valid operators are: (drop ?obj ?room ?gripper) (move ?from ?to) (pick ?obj ?room ?gripper).
Fix the code.
