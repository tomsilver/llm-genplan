The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves analyzing the provided actions and their preconditions and effects. Since there are only three actions (operators), we can follow a step-by-step process to achieve the goals:

1. Identify the goal conditions involving predicate0 relationships, and note the object pairs for which predicate0 should hold in the goal state.

2. For each object pair in the goal state, perform the following steps:

   a. If the object pair already has the predicate0 relationship in the initial state, no action is needed for that pair.
   
   b. If the object pair doesn't have the predicate0 relationship in the initial state, use operator1 to update the predicate1 property. Ensure that the second object in the pair has predicate1.
   
   c. Use operator2 to unlink the first object from its current second object in the predicate0 relationship. This can be done by applying operator2 with the first object, its current second object, and an available object with predicate5 and predicate6 properties.
   
   d. Use operator0 to link the first object to the second object in the goal pair. This can be done by applying operator0 with the first object, the second object (which now has predicate1), and the same object with predicate6 used in the previous step.

By following this strategy, you can achieve the goal state without using search algorithms. This is possible because the domain has a limited number of actions, and their preconditions and effects can be directly manipulated to satisfy the goal conditions.
