The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a sequential approach for each car that needs to be moved:

Sail the ferry to the location where the car is.
Board the car onto the ferry.
Sail the ferry to the desired destination location.
Debark the car from the ferry.
This strategy works for all problems in this domain since the ferry can only carry one car at a time, and there are no additional constraints or requirements. Repeat this process for each car that needs to be moved, and you will achieve the goal configuration.
