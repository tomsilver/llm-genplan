The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is as follows:

1. Sort the items in descending order based on their weight, ensuring the heaviest item is first in the list.
2. Execute the 'pack-first' action for the heaviest item (first item in the sorted list).
3. Iterate through the remaining items in the sorted list, and for each item, execute the 'stack' action, placing the current item on top of the previously packed item.

By following this strategy, all items will be packed in the box with the heaviest items at the bottom, satisfying the conditions specified in the domain.
