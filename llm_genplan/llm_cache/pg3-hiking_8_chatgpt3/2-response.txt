The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to use a graph search algorithm to create a graph of the hiking map, with the locations as nodes and the trails as edges. Then, use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path from the starting location to the goal location, taking into account the properties of each location (i.e., whether it is a hill or water source). 

Once the shortest path is found, the hiker can follow that path by walking or climbing as necessary until they reach the goal location. This strategy eliminates the need for search in the planning process and relies on the pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path. However, this strategy assumes that the map is static and that there are no other obstacles or factors that could affect the pathfinding algorithm's performance.
