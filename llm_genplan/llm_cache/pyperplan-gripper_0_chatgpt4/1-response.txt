A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a fixed sequence of actions repeatedly until all the balls are moved from rooma to roomb. Here is the strategy:

    Pick up a ball in rooma with the left gripper.
    If there is another ball in rooma, pick it up with the right gripper.
    Move from rooma to roomb.
    If carrying a ball in the right gripper, drop it in roomb.
    Drop the ball in the left gripper in roomb.
    Move back to rooma.
    Repeat steps 1-6 until all balls are moved from rooma to roomb.

This strategy guarantees that all balls will be eventually moved from rooma to roomb, as it systematically picks up, moves, and drops the balls in the destination room. It doesn't require any search since the sequence of actions remains the same for every pair of balls, regardless of the number of balls or their initial positions in rooma.
