A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a fixed sequence of actions repeatedly until all balls are moved from rooma to roomb. Here's the strategy:

    Move to rooma (if Robby is not already there).
    Pick a ball using the left gripper (if it's free and there's a ball available in rooma).
    If the left gripper is holding a ball, and the right gripper is free, pick another ball in rooma using the right gripper (if there's another ball available).
    Move to roomb.
    If the left gripper is holding a ball, drop the ball in roomb using the left gripper.
    If the right gripper is holding a ball, drop the ball in roomb using the right gripper.
    If there are still balls left in rooma, go back to step 1 and repeat the process.

This strategy ensures that Robby efficiently moves up to two balls at a time from rooma to roomb until all balls are in roomb.
