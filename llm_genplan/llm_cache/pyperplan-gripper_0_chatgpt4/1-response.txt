A simple strategy for solving all problems in the gripper-strips domain without using search would be to perform the following steps:

    Pick up the maximum number of balls possible in the initial room (rooma) using the available grippers (left and right). In this case, since there are two grippers, the maximum number of balls picked up at once would be two.

    Move to the destination room (roomb).

    Drop the balls in the destination room (roomb).

    Check if there are still balls left in the initial room (rooma). If so, go back to step 1. If not, the problem is solved.

By following this strategy, you can sequentially move all the balls from the initial room (rooma) to the destination room (roomb) without the need for search.
