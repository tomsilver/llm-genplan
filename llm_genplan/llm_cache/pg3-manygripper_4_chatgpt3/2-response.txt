The simple strategy for solving all problems in the gripper-strips domain without using search is to use a simple reflex agent that follows a set of predefined rules for moving and manipulating balls based on its current perception of the world state. The agent can be programmed to follow a series of rules that dictate which action to take based on the current state of the world. These rules might include moving to a room with a ball, picking up a ball with an available gripper, dropping a ball off in a target room, etc. This strategy is feasible for this domain because there is a limited number of possible actions and states, and the rules can be hard-coded based on the domain definition. However, this strategy may not be applicable or optimal for more complex domains with larger state spaces and more possible actions.
