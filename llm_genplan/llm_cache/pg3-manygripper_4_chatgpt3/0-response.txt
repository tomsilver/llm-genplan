The gripper-strips domain involves a robot named Robby that can move around in a series of rooms, pick up and carry balls with two grippers, and drop them off in other rooms. The domain defines predicates for rooms, balls, grippers, and their locations, as well as actions for moving, picking up, and dropping off balls. The two example problems involve Robby moving and manipulating multiple balls to achieve specific goals of placing them in different rooms.
