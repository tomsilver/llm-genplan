A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to sequentially pick up and drop balls as per the goal state. Here's the step-by-step approach:

Look at the goal state and identify the desired positions of the balls.
Move Robby to the room where the first ball in the goal state is located.
Pick up the ball using one of the free grippers.
Move Robby to the room where the ball should be placed according to the goal state.
Drop the ball in the room.
Repeat steps 2-5 for each ball specified in the goal state.
This approach does not require any search or planning algorithms. It's a straightforward strategy that works in this domain since there are no complex constraints or interactions between actions, and there's always a free gripper to pick up and drop balls. However, this strategy may not be the most efficient, as it doesn't optimize for the shortest or quickest solution.
