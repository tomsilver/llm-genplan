In this domain, the goal is to have the predicate6 applied to all objects of type4. Based on the structure of the domain and the actions, we can derive a simple strategy to solve all problems without using search. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. For each object of type4 (for which predicate3 holds), find the associated object of type2 (for which predicate0 holds).

2. Then, for each object of type3 (for which predicate0 holds with the type2 object found in step 1), find the associated object of type6 (for which predicate1 holds).

3. Make sure predicate7 holds for each object of type6 found in step 2.

4. Execute operator1 action for each object of type4 (from step 1), object of type2 (from step 1), object of type3 (from step 2), and object of type6 (from step 2). This will make predicate6 hold for all objects of type4 and achieve the goal.

By following these steps, we can directly reach the goal state without the need for any search algorithms.
