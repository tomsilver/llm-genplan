This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," has two types of objects: type0 and type2, with type1 as their parent. The domain includes six predicates and four operators. The operators are used to manipulate the state of the domain in various ways, such as establishing relationships between objects, changing the state of type2 objects, and moving type0 objects between different states.

The example problems provided give specific instances of objects and their initial states. The goal for these problems is to achieve a certain configuration of object states using the operators provided in the domain. In "my-problem-9," the goal is to change the state of object5 to "predicate8." In "my-problem-5," the goal is to change the state of six type2 objects (object12 to object17) to "predicate8."
