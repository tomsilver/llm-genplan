The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves following a sequence of steps using the operators provided:

1. Identify the type0 object that is in the "predicate6" state.
2. Use the "operator0" action to apply the "predicate2" state to the type2 object that is associated with the type0 object from step 1 through the "predicate7" relationship.
3. Use the "operator1" action to change the state of the type2 object from step 2 to the "predicate8" state, which is one of the goal states.

If there are multiple type2 objects in the goal state, repeat steps 1-3 for each of them.

This strategy works without search because the operators are designed in such a way that executing these actions in this order directly leads to the desired goal state without requiring exploration of alternative paths.
