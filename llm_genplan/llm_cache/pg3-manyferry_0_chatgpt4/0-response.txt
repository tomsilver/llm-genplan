The Ferry domain is a planning problem that involves transporting cars between various locations using a ferry. The domain consists of three main actions: sail, board, and debark.

The sail action moves the ferry from one location to another, given that the two locations are not the same. The board action is used to load a car onto the ferry from a specified location, given that the car is at that location, the ferry is also at that location, and the ferry is empty. The debark action unloads a car from the ferry at a specified location, provided that the car is on the ferry and the ferry is at the specified location.

The domain includes predicates to define cars, locations, and the relationship between them, such as at (car is at a location), at-ferry (ferry is at a location), and on (car is on the ferry). The empty-ferry predicate indicates whether the ferry is empty or not. The not-eq predicate is used to ensure that two locations are not the same.

Example problems in this domain involve initial configurations of cars at various locations, the ferry at a specific location, and the desired goal state of cars at different locations. The objective is to find a sequence of actions that can achieve the goal state using the ferry to transport cars between locations.
