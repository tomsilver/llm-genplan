This domain describes a ferry transportation system for cars. There are several locations and cars in the system. The domain has three actions: sail, board, and debark. The sail action allows the ferry to move between locations, while the board action allows a car to board the ferry at a location, and the debark action allows a car to leave the ferry at a location. The goal of this domain is to transport the cars to their desired locations using the ferry.
