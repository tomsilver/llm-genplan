The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves following these steps:

    Identify the current locations of the cars and the desired goal locations for each car.
    Sail the ferry to the location of the first car that needs to be transported.
    Board the car onto the ferry (provided the ferry is empty).
    Sail the ferry to the goal location of the car.
    Debark the car at the goal location, leaving the ferry empty.
    Repeat steps 2-5 for each car that needs to be transported to a different location, in any order.

By following these steps, the ferry sequentially transports each car to its goal location. The ferry always starts empty and becomes empty after each debark action, ensuring that it can pick up the next car. This strategy eliminates the need for search algorithms, as the solution can be directly derived from the initial and goal states.
