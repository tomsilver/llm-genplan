The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to sequentially transport the cars to their desired locations. Follow these steps:

    Identify the car that needs to be transported and its destination.
    Sail the ferry to the location where the car is currently parked.
    Board the car onto the ferry.
    Sail the ferry to the desired destination of the car.
    Debark the car from the ferry at the destination.
    Repeat steps 1-5 for all cars that need to be transported.

This strategy ensures that cars are transported one by one to their respective destinations using the ferry, without the need for any search algorithm.
