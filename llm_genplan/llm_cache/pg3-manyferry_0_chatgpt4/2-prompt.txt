Implement the strategy as a Python function.

The code should should be of the form

def get_plan(task):
    # Your code here
    return plan

where
    - `task.objects` is a set of objects (string names)
    - `task.init` is a set of ground atoms represented as tuples of predicate
       names and arguments (e.g., ('predicate-foo', 'object-bar', ...))
    - `task.goal` is also a set of ground atoms represented in the same way
    - `plan` is a list of actions, where each action is a ground operator
       represented as a string (e.g., '(operator-baz object-qux ...)')
