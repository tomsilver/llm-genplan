The "heavy-pack" domain is a simple domain for modeling the problem of packing heavy items into a box. The domain consists of two actions: "pack-first", which packs the first item into an empty box, and "stack", which stacks an item on top of another if it is heavier and both are packed or unpacked. The domain also includes predicates for describing the state of the items, including whether they are packed or unpacked, and whether there is anything above them. The goal of the problem is to pack all the given items into the box.
