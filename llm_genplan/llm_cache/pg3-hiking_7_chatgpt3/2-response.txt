The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always move to an adjacent location that is not water, until the goal location is reached. This can be done by repeatedly applying the "walk" action to the current location and an adjacent non-water location. If the current location is next to a hill, the "climb" action can be used instead of "walk" to move to the hill. This strategy is guaranteed to work as long as there is a path of adjacent non-water locations from the initial state to the goal state.
