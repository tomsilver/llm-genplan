A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search would involve executing actions in a specific order, based on the goal and initial state.

1. Identify all type4 objects in the initial state that have predicate3 and need to have predicate6 in the goal state.
2. For each of these objects, find the corresponding type2 object they are related to through predicate0.
3. For each type2 object, find the type3 object related to it through predicate0, and the type6 object related to it through predicate0.
4. Execute the operator0 action for the type2, type6, and type3 objects to create a predicate1 relation between the type3 and type6 objects.
5. Ensure all type6 objects have the predicate7 relation.
6. Execute the operator1 action for the type2, type6, type3, and type4 objects to remove predicate3 and predicate7 relations and create the predicate6 relation for the type4 objects.
7. The goal is achieved when all type4 objects have the predicate6 relation.

This strategy relies on the structure of the domain and the relationships between objects to systematically achieve the goal state without the need for search.
