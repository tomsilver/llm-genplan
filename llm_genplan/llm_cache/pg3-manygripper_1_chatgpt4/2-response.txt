A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be based on a greedy approach, following these steps:

Identify the balls that need to be moved to a target room according to the goal state.
Move Robby to the room where one of the balls to be moved is located.
Check if any of the grippers is free. If none is free, drop the least prioritized carried ball in the current room, and continue to step 4. If at least one gripper is free, continue to step 4.
Pick up the ball using a free gripper.
Move Robby to the target room for the ball.
Drop the ball in the target room.
Repeat steps 2-6 until all the balls have been moved to their target rooms according to the goal state.

While this strategy is simple and easy to implement, it may not be the most efficient in terms of the number of actions needed to achieve the goal state. However, it guarantees to solve the problem without the need for search.
