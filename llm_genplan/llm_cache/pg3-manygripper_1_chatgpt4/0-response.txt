The gripper-strips domain represents a simplified robotic manipulation environment. The domain includes rooms, balls, and grippers. The robot, Robby, can perform three main actions: move, pick, and drop.

The 'move' action allows Robby to move between different rooms, given that the 'from' and 'to' rooms are defined. The 'pick' action allows Robby to pick up a ball from a room using a gripper, given that the ball is present in the room, Robby is in the same room, and the gripper is free. Lastly, the 'drop' action enables Robby to drop a ball from a gripper into a room, given that the ball is carried by the gripper and Robby is in the room.

The example problems provided in this domain involve moving Robby and manipulating balls with grippers in various room configurations to achieve specific goal states.
