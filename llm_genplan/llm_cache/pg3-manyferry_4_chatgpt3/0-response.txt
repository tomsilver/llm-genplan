The ferry domain is a planning problem where there is a ferry that can transport cars between different locations. The problem involves three actions: sailing the ferry from one location to another, boarding a car onto the ferry, and debarking a car from the ferry. The domain includes predicates for the location of cars and the ferry, and whether the ferry is empty. The goal of the problem is to transport a set of cars from their initial locations to their final locations using the ferry. The problem involves specifying the initial and final locations of the cars, the initial location of the ferry, and the locations that the cars need to be transported to.
