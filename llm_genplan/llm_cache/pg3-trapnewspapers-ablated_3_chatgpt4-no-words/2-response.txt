The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the actions in a specific order that fulfills the preconditions of each action and achieves the desired goal state. Here is the strategy:

1. Execute the `operator1` action repeatedly, as needed, to move the `predicate0` from one object to another of type0, until it reaches an object that also has the `predicate9`. For example, in my-problem-4, the object with `predicate0` (object0) already has `predicate9`. In my-problem-3, you need to use `operator1` to move `predicate0` from object0 to object3 or object4.

2. Execute the `operator2` action with an object of type1 with `predicate8` (e.g., object5) and the object of type0 with both `predicate0` and `predicate9`. This will remove `predicate8` from the type1 object and add `predicate1` to it.

3. Execute the `operator0` action with the type1 object that now has `predicate1` and the type0 object with both `predicate0` and `predicate9`. This will remove `predicate1` from the type1 object, remove `predicate9` from the type0 object, and add `predicate7` to the type0 object.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all type0 objects with `predicate9` until all of them have `predicate7` instead.

By following this strategy, you can systematically fulfill the goal conditions for all problems in this domain without the need for a search algorithm.
