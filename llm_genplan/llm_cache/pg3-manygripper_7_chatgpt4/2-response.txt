The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves following these steps:

Identify the goal states, which indicate the target locations for the balls.
For each ball in the goal state, execute the following steps:
a. Move Robby to the room where the ball is currently located.
b. Pick up the ball using a free gripper.
c. Move Robby to the room where the ball needs to be according to the goal state.
d. Drop the ball in that room, freeing the gripper.
Repeat steps 2a-2d for each ball in the goal state until all balls are in their target locations.
This strategy assumes that there are enough grippers for Robby to pick up the balls one by one, and the rooms are easily accessible. It is a straightforward approach that may not be the most efficient but can solve the problems in this domain without the need for search algorithms.
