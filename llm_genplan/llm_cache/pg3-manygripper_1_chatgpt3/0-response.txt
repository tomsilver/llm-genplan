The gripper-strips domain involves a robot named Robby that can move between different rooms and pick up balls using grippers. The domain defines predicates such as room, ball, gripper, at-robby, at, free, and carry. The available actions are move, pick, and drop. The goal of the problem instances is typically to move the balls to specific rooms. The problem instances specify the initial positions of the balls, the grippers, and Robby, as well as the desired final positions of the balls.
