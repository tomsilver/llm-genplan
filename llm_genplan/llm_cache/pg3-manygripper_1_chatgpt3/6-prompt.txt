The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 99, in get_plan
    ball_loc = [arg for (pred, arg1, arg2) in init if pred == "at" and arg1 == ball][0]
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ball_loc = [arg for (pred, arg1, arg2) in init if pred == "at" and arg1 == ball][0]
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

Fix the code.
