The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to use a greedy algorithm that always chooses the closest ball to Robby's current location and moves it to its goal position. This can be done by calculating the Manhattan distance between Robby and each ball, and then choosing the ball with the smallest distance. Once a ball is picked up, the gripper can be used to carry it to the goal position. This process can be repeated until all balls are in their goal positions. Since the domain and problem instances do not include any obstacles or barriers, this greedy algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. However, it may not always find the shortest solution.
