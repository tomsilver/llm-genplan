A simple strategy for solving all problems in this heavy-pack domain without using search is to follow these steps:

1. Sort the items in descending order of their weight, with the heaviest item first.
2. Use the `pack-first` action to pack the heaviest item into the empty box.
3. Iterate through the sorted list of items, and for each item, use the `stack` action to stack it on top of the currently heaviest packed item that is lighter than the item being stacked.

By following this strategy, you ensure that items are always stacked according to the weight constraints specified in the domain, and all items will be packed without the need for search.
