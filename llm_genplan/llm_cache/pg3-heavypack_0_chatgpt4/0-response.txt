The "heavy-pack" domain is concerned with packing objects in a box, ensuring that heavier objects are placed below lighter ones. There are several predicates in this domain: `heavier`, which indicates if one item is heavier than another; `packed`, indicating if an item is packed in the box; `unpacked`, representing items not yet packed; `nothing-above`, which means no item is placed above the specified one; and `box-empty`, which indicates the box is empty.

There are two actions in this domain: `pack-first`, which packs the first item in an empty box, and `stack`, which stacks an item on top of another, ensuring that the bottom item is heavier than the top one. The goal is to have all items packed in the box, maintaining the weight order. The example problems given define different sets of objects and their relative weights, with the objective of packing them according to the domain's constraints.
