Given this task:
(define (problem prob0 (:domain spanner)
  (:objects
    gate - location

    location3 - location
    location4 - location
    shed - location
    bob - man

    nut2 - nut
    nut3 - nut

    spanner3 - spanner
  )
  (:init
    (at bob shed)

    (at nut3 gate)
    (at spanner1 location4)
    (at spanner2 location4)
    (at spanner3 location1)
    (link location1 location2)

    (loose nut1)

    (loose nut3)
    (useable spanner1)

  )
  (:goal (and
    (tightened nut1)
    (tightened nut2)
    (tightened nut3)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 940, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 114, in <module>
    print(get_plan(objects, init, goal))
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 90, in get_plan
    while goal.difference(state):
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'difference'

Fix the code.
