The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to use a basic form of planning called "means-ends analysis." The idea is to iteratively reduce the distance between the current state and the goal state by finding actions that achieve sub-goals that lead towards the overall goal. 

In the spanner domain, this means-ends analysis strategy can be implemented as follows:

1. Initialize the current state to the problem's initial state.
2. Check if the current state satisfies the goal state. If it does, then the problem is already solved.
3. If the current state does not satisfy the goal state, choose an unsatisfied sub-goal from the goal state.
4. Identify a relevant action that achieves that sub-goal. This can be done by checking whether an action's effects satisfy the sub-goal.
5. If a relevant action is found, apply it to the current state to generate a new state.
6. Repeat from step 2 with the new state as the current state.
7. If no relevant action is found, then the problem is unsolvable.

By iteratively applying this means-ends analysis strategy, the agent can find a sequence of actions that leads to the goal state.
