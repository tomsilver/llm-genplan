The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to sort the items in descending order based on their weight and then pack them sequentially. By doing this, you ensure that each item is always placed on top of a heavier item, satisfying the domain constraints. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Create a list of all unpacked items.
2. Sort the list in descending order based on the weight relations given in the problem.
3. Pack the heaviest item first using the 'pack-first' action.
4. Iterate through the sorted list and pack the remaining items using the 'stack' action, placing each item on top of the previously packed item.

By following this strategy, you can solve any problem in the heavy-pack domain without needing to search for a solution.
