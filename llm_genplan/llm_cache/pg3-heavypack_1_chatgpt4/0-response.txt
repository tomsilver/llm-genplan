The heavy-pack domain focuses on packing items into a box in a specific order, with heavier items placed below lighter ones. The domain has a set of predicates to represent the relations between items, including whether an item is heavier than another, whether an item is packed or unpacked, and whether an item has nothing above it in the box. There are also two actions: pack-first and stack. The pack-first action is used to pack the first item into an empty box, while the stack action is used to stack one item on top of another. Example problems are provided, which include objects with defined weights, the initial state of the box and items, and the goal of having all items packed in the box according to the weight constraints.
