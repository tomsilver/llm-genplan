A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow a sequential approach by applying the actions in a specific order:

1. Apply operator0: For each type2 object, find a type0 object that satisfies predicate6 and is related through predicate7. Apply operator0 to change the state of the type2 object to predicate2.

2. Apply operator1: For each type2 object in the predicate2 state, find a type0 object that satisfies predicate6 and is related through predicate4. Apply operator1 to change the state of the type2 object from predicate2 to predicate8.

By following this strategy, we ensure that all type2 objects reach the desired predicate8 state, which is the primary goal of the problems in this domain. This approach does not require searching through different possibilities, as it directly leverages the available relationships and properties among objects.
