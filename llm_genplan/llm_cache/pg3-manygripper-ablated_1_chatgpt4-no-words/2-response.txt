A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search can be achieved by sequentially applying the operators based on the goal state. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the desired predicate0 relationships in the goal state. For each of these relationships, note the required objects involved.

2. Check the initial state to see if any of the desired predicate0 relationships already exist. If they do, proceed to the next desired relationship.

3. For the remaining relationships, identify the current predicate0 relationship involving the objects from the goal state. Use Operator1 to make the corresponding object available (by satisfying predicate1) if it is not already available.

4. Find an available object that satisfies predicate6 and predicate5 in the initial state.

5. Use Operator2 to remove the existing predicate0 relationship between the objects and establish a predicate3 relationship with the available object that satisfies predicate6 and predicate5.

6. Apply Operator0 to break the predicate3 relationship and establish the desired predicate0 relationship from the goal state. This will also make the object that previously satisfied predicate6 and predicate5 available for another goal relationship.

7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each desired predicate0 relationship in the goal state that is not already satisfied in the initial state.

By following this strategy, you can achieve the goal state without the need for search, as the operators are applied in a deterministic order based on the requirements of the goal state.
