The "spanner" domain is a planning problem domain that involves a man, several spanners, nuts, and several locations. The objective is to use the spanners to tighten all the loose nuts located in various locations. The man can pick up and carry spanners, walk between locations linked together, and use spanners to tighten nuts. The domain involves constraints such as the man can only carry one spanner at a time, each nut can only be tightened once, and each spanner can only be used once before becoming unusable. The domain is represented in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) with actions such as "walk", "pickup_spanner", and "tighten_nut", and predicates such as "at", "carrying", "useable", "tightened", and "loose". The domain also includes two example problems with different initial and goal states.
