There is no single code provided in the task to be fixed. However, based on the context of the previous task, it seems that the error occurred due to an unclosed square bracket in the following line of code:

```
current_location = state[
```

To fix this error, we need to add a closing square bracket to the end of the line of code, like this:

```
current_location = state[]
```
