It seems that there is no code provided in the task to be fixed, and the error message is referring to the caret symbol (^) which is pointing to an invalid syntax in the error message itself.

As there is no specific code to fix, I cannot provide any solution to this task. Please provide more information or a corrected version of the task if possible.
