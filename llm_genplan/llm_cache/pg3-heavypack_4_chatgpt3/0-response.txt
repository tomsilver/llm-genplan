The heavy-pack domain is a planning domain that involves packing items into a box while taking into consideration their weight. The domain has predicates for describing whether an item is packed or unpacked, whether an item is heavier than another, whether there is nothing above an item, and whether the box is empty. The actions available in this domain are packing the first item into the box and stacking an item on top of another, provided that the bottom item is already packed, there is nothing above it, and the top item is heavier and unpacked. The goal of the domain is to pack all items into the box.
