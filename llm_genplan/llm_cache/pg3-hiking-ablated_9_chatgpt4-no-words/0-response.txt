This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain", involves objects of type "type0" and five predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5. The domain has two operators: operator1 and operator0. Both operators have two parameters, ?v0 and ?v4, which are of type "type0". The preconditions and effects for each operator are defined using conjunctions of the predicates.

The example problems provided, "my-problem-3" and "my-problem-2", consist of objects of type "type0" and use the predicates to establish the initial state of the objects. Each problem has a specific goal, which is to satisfy a certain predicate for a specific object. The problems are defined within the "my-pddl-domain" and share common elements, such as objects and predicates, but differ in their initial states and goals.
