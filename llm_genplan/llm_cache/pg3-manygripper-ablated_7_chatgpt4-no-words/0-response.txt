This PDDL domain represents a system with various objects and predicates that describe relationships among these objects. There are three operators (actions) defined in this domain: operator1, operator2, and operator0.

The system consists of objects that belong to certain predicates:
- predicate9: Represents a group of objects.
- predicate2: Represents a group of objects that perform certain actions.
- predicate6: Represents a group of objects with specific properties.
- predicate1: Represents objects with a certain attribute.
- predicate0: Represents a relationship between two objects.
- predicate5: Represents objects with a specific state.
- predicate3: Represents a relationship between two objects with different properties.

The actions have the following effects:
1. operator1: Transfers a specific attribute from one object to another.
2. operator2: Changes the relationship between two objects and modifies the state of one of the objects.
3. operator0: Reverts the changes made by operator2, restoring the previous relationship and state.

The example problems provide initial states and goals for specific situations within this domain. The problems involve rearranging relationships between objects and achieving desired states using the defined actions.
