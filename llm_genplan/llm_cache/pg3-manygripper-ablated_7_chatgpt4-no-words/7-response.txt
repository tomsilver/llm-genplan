I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. I misunderstood the context of the problem. The error provided is a traceback from a Python script, and the error message you provided is not part of the code. The SyntaxError at line 59 is likely caused by something else in your Python script.

To help you fix the issue, please provide the relevant portion of the Python code that is causing the SyntaxError, and I will be able to assist you with the appropriate modifications.
