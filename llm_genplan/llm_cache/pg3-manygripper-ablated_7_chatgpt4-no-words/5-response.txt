It appears my previous response was unclear. I apologize for the confusion. In order to provide a solution, I will need more information about the operators and their preconditions. Specifically, I need to know which operators set `(predicate6 none)` to true, `(predicate0 object5 object22)` to true, and `(predicate5 none)` to true. 

Once I have this information, I will be able to provide a corrected plan that satisfies the preconditions for the given problem.
