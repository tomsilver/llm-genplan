I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. It seems that there was a misunderstanding regarding the nature of the problem. It appears that the issue is within a Python script and not within the PDDL problem definition itself. Based on the traceback provided, there is a SyntaxError in the file.

Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a direct solution as I do not have access to the Python code or the specific file that is raising the exception. To fix the error, please provide the relevant portion of the Python code that is causing the issue, and I will be able to help you with the appropriate modifications.
