A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be achieved by analyzing the initial state, the goal state, and the operators available. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects that need to be connected (predicate0) as per the goal state.
2. For each of these connections, check if the desired connection is already established in the initial state. If yes, no action is needed for that specific connection.
3. For the connections not yet established, identify the objects involved, and perform the following:
   a. Use operator1 to transfer the predicate1 attribute to the target object (the second object in the predicate0 connection).
   b. Find an available object with predicate5 and predicate6 that is not currently involved in any other predicate0 connections.
   c. Use operator2 to break the existing connection of the source object (the first object in the predicate0 connection) and establish a new connection with the target object, while also linking the source object to the object found in step 3b (with predicate5 and predicate6).
   d. Use operator0 to revert the changes made to the object found in step 3b, restoring its previous state and connection.

By following this strategy, all desired connections in the goal state can be achieved without using search algorithms.
