The Miconic domain models a simplified elevator system that serves passengers and moves between floors in a building. The domain has two object types: passenger and floor. It has four predicates: origin, destin, above, boarded, served, and lift-at, which represent the initial location of a passenger, their destination, the relative order of floors, whether a passenger is on board, whether a passenger has reached their destination, and the current floor of the lift, respectively.

There are four actions in this domain: board, depart, up, and down. The board action allows a passenger to board the lift if it is on the floor where the passenger's origin is. The depart action allows a passenger to leave the lift when it reaches their destination floor. The up action moves the lift one floor up, and the down action moves the lift one floor down.

The example problems provided describe different scenarios in which passengers need to be served by the elevator system. The problems define the objects (floors and passengers), initialize the system with the relationships between the objects (e.g., which floor is above which), and set the goal state where all passengers are served (i.e., they have reached their destination floors).
