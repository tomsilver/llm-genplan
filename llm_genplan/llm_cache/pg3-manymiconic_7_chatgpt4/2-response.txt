The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is called the "Sweep" strategy. This approach involves moving the elevator from the lowest to the highest floor, stopping at each floor to let passengers board if their origin is on that floor, and then letting passengers depart if their destination is on that floor. After reaching the highest floor, the elevator moves back down, again stopping at each floor to let passengers board or depart. This process continues until all passengers have reached their destinations.

In the Miconic domain, this strategy works well because there are no constraints on the capacity of the elevator, and there are no time or efficiency considerations. The Sweep strategy guarantees that all passengers will eventually be served, as the elevator will visit all floors in both directions.
