The "spanner" domain represents a simplified problem-solving scenario where a man named Bob must tighten a set of loose nuts at a gate. The domain includes various objects such as locations, a man (Bob), nuts, and spanners. The locations are interconnected through links, allowing Bob to move between them. The nuts are either loose or tightened, and the spanners are either usable or not. The actions available in the domain are walking, picking up a spanner, and tightening a nut. The goal is to tighten all the nuts using the spanners available while navigating the interconnected locations. Example problems demonstrate scenarios where Bob must figure out a sequence of actions to accomplish the goal.
