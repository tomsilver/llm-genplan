The gripper-strips domain describes a scenario where a robot called Robby can move around different rooms and use grippers to pick up balls located in those rooms. The domain has three predicates: room, ball, and gripper, which represent the state of the world. The actions available to Robby are move, pick, and drop, which allow him to move between rooms, pick up a ball, and drop a ball, respectively. The problems specified in this domain involve finding a sequence of actions that will achieve a specific goal, which is to move balls to specific locations. The problems involve a set of initial conditions, such as the locations of the balls and the robot, and the state of the grippers. The goal of the problem is to find a sequence of actions that will result in the robot moving the balls to their desired locations.
