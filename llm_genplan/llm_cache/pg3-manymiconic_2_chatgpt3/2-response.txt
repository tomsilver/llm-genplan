The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to use a fixed sequence of actions that moves the elevator up and down to pick up and drop off passengers in a predetermined order. Specifically, the elevator should move up from the ground floor, picking up passengers who are waiting at each floor, until it reaches the top floor. Then it should move down, dropping off each passenger at their destination floor along the way, until it reaches the ground floor again. This strategy assumes that all passengers can be picked up in a single trip and that there are no conflicts between passengers trying to get on or off the elevator at the same time. If these assumptions do not hold, a more sophisticated strategy or search algorithm may be necessary.
