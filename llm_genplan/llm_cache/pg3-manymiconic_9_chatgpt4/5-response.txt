It seems there is an issue with the initial plan that is generated. The plan starts with the action (down f2_b1 f0_b0), but the precondition for this action is not satisfied, as there is no fact (above f0_b0 f2_b1) in the initial state. To fix the code, I recommend updating the initial state with the correct facts and relationships between the objects. Since the lift is initially at f2_b1, it is better to start with an action that boards a passenger at that floor.

Here is an updated problem definition with the correct initial state:
