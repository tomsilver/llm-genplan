It seems the issue is that the lift is not at the correct starting position. The lift starts at floors f2_b1 and f6_b0, but the plan starts with moving up from f0_b0 to f1_b0. To fix the code, you need to move the lift to the correct position before executing the plan.

The following plan takes into consideration the initial lift positions:

```
1. (move f2_b1 f0_b1) ; Move lift to the correct position
2. (up f0_b1 f1_b1) ; Start the plan from here
3. (depart f1_b1 p3_b1)
4. (board f1_b1 p0_b1)
5. ...
```

Note that you also need to change the initial position of the other lift from f6_b0 to f0_b0 and update the plan accordingly.

You can also modify the initial state by changing the lift positions to f0_b0 and f0_b1. Then, the plan will be executable without any unsatisfied preconditions.
