A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow the ontrail predicate. As the ontrail predicate represents the predefined path between locations, it essentially lays out the optimal path from the starting location to the goal location.

To implement this strategy, start at the initial location and iteratively follow the ontrail predicate until the goal location is reached. This approach ensures that the agent avoids hills and water, as the ontrail predicate would only include valid movements based on the rules defined in the domain.
