A simple strategy to solve all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

Create a list of all loose nuts, and sort it based on their locations.
Create a list of all useable spanners, and sort it based on their locations.
Starting from Bob's initial location (shed), find the closest spanner location and walk to it.
Pick up the first available spanner from the sorted spanner list.
Walk to the location of the first loose nut in the sorted nuts list.
Tighten the nut using the carried spanner.
Remove the tightened nut from the list of loose nuts.
If there are still loose nuts left, check if the carried spanner is still useable. If not, find the closest spanner location, walk to it, and pick up a new spanner.
Repeat steps 5 to 8 until all nuts in the list are tightened.
This strategy assumes that there are enough useable spanners available to tighten all loose nuts and that the walking distance between locations is not a concern. It also assumes that each location is connected to at least one other location, allowing Bob to walk between them.
