This domain, named "spanner," models a problem where a man named Bob needs to tighten a series of loose nuts at a gate using available spanners (wrenches) scattered across various locations. The domain includes the following types: location, locatable (man, nut, and spanner are subtypes of locatable). There are several predicates to describe the state of the objects, such as their location, whether Bob is carrying a spanner, if a spanner is useable, the connection between locations, and the state of the nuts (tightened or loose).

There are three main actions in this domain: "walk" (Bob moving from one location to another), "pickup_spanner" (Bob picking up a spanner at a location), and "tighten_nut" (Bob using a spanner to tighten a loose nut at a location). The domain is designed to find a sequence of actions for Bob to tighten all loose nuts using the available spanners. Two example problems are provided with different object configurations, requiring Bob to tighten a different number of nuts.
