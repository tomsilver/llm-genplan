The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves applying the actions in the following order:

1. Apply `operator0` with ?v1 as any object from the problem. This will negate `predicate0`, apply `predicate4` and `predicate2` to the chosen object, and negate `predicate6` for the chosen object.
2. For each remaining object, apply `operator1` using the object from step 1 as ?v0 and the current remaining object as ?v4. This will ensure that `predicate4` and `predicate2` hold for all objects.

By following this strategy, the goal of having `predicate4` hold for all objects will be achieved. The key is to first use `operator0` to set the initial object, and then iteratively use `operator1` to propagate the `predicate4` property to all other objects.
