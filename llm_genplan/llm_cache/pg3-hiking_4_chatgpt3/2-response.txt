The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow the trail and move from one location to another while avoiding hills and bodies of water. This can be done by selecting the next adjacent location on the trail and checking whether it is a hill or water. If it is not, then the agent moves to that location; otherwise, it stays in the current location and selects another adjacent location. The process continues until the goal location is reached. Since the hiking domain does not have obstacles or complex terrain, this strategy is guaranteed to succeed in finding a solution if one exists. This strategy can be implemented using simple conditionals and loops in any programming language.
