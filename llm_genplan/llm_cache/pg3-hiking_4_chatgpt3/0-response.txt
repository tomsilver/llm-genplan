The hiking domain defines a set of actions and predicates for a hiking scenario where the agent can walk or climb from one location to another on a trail. The domain includes types, predicates to represent location, water and hill, and actions to move between locations. The problem instances define the initial state of the hiking environment with the location of the agent and the location of water and hills. The goal is to reach a specific location on the trail.
