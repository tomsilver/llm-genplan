This PDDL domain, called "my-pddl-domain", consists of 7 predicates and 3 operators.

The predicates are as follows:
1. predicate0: Takes 2 variables.
2. predicate1: Takes 1 variable.
3. predicate2: Takes 1 variable.
4. predicate3: Takes 2 variables.
5. predicate5: Takes 1 variable.
6. predicate6: Takes 1 variable.
7. predicate9: Takes 1 variable.

The operators are as follows:
1. operator1: Takes 2 parameters, has preconditions involving predicates 1 and 9, and affects predicates 1.
2. operator2: Takes 3 parameters, has preconditions involving predicates 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9, and affects predicates 0, 3, and 5.
3. operator0: Takes 3 parameters, has preconditions involving predicates 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, and affects predicates 0, 3, and 5.

There are two example problems provided: "my-problem-9" and "my-problem-5". Each problem has a list of objects and initial conditions (described using the predicates) and a goal state. The goal state for each problem is represented using the predicate0 with specific object pairs. The objective of the planning problem is to find a sequence of actions (using the operators) that transitions from the initial state to the goal state.
