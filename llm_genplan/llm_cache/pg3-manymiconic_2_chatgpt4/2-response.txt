A simple strategy to solve all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is the "Sweep" or "SCAN" method. The elevator starts at the lowest or highest floor and moves in one direction (up or down), stopping at every floor along the way. At each floor, the elevator picks up any waiting passengers and drops off any passengers whose destination is that floor. Once the elevator reaches the top or bottom floor, it reverses direction and repeats the process. This process continues until all passengers have been served.

This strategy guarantees that all passengers will eventually be served, as the elevator visits every floor in both directions. However, it may not be the most efficient solution, as the elevator makes unnecessary stops at floors where no passengers need to board or depart.
