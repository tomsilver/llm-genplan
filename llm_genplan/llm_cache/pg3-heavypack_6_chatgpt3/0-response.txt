The heavy-pack domain is a planning domain that involves packing a set of objects into a box. The domain consists of two actions: "pack-first" and "stack". The "pack-first" action is used to pack the first object into an empty box, and the "stack" action is used to stack objects on top of each other, subject to the constraint that the object on the bottom must be packed, nothing can be above it, and the object on top must be unpacked and heavier than the one below it. The goal of the domain is to pack all the objects into the box, subject to the constraints of the "stack" action. Two example problems are provided, each with a set of objects to be packed and the goal of packing all the objects into the box.
