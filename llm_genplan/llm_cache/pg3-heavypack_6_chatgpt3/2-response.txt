Yes, there is a simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search. The strategy involves sorting the objects by weight, heaviest first, and then packing them into the box one by one. Specifically, the objects are packed in the following order:

1. The heaviest object is packed first using the "pack-first" action.
2. All remaining objects are sorted in descending order of weight.
3. For each object in the sorted list, the "stack" action is applied to stack it on top of the previously packed objects, subject to the constraints of the "stack" action.

This strategy guarantees that each object is packed in a valid position, and no object is placed on top of another that is lighter than itself. Therefore, the goal of packing all objects into the box will be achieved. Since this strategy does not involve any search, it is much more efficient than a search-based approach, especially for large problem instances.
