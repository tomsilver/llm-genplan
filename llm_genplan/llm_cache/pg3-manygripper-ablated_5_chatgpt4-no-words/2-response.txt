The strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search consists of systematically applying the three operators in a specific order to achieve the goal conditions. Here's the strategy:

1. Identify the goal conditions, which are the desired relationships between objects (predicate0).

2. For each goal condition, find the objects involved and their current relationships (predicate0 or predicate3).

3. Use operator1 to transfer the predicate1 relation to the objects that are not currently related to predicate1 but are required by the goal conditions.

4. If the objects involved in the goal condition are currently related through predicate3, apply operator0 to remove the predicate3 relation and establish the predicate0 and predicate5 relations.

5. If the objects involved in the goal condition are not currently related through predicate0 or predicate3, apply operator2 to establish the predicate3 relation by removing the predicate0 and predicate5 relations.

6. For each object that needs to be related to another object according to the goal conditions, apply operator0 or operator2 as needed to establish the required predicate0 relations.

By following these steps, we can achieve the goal conditions without using a search algorithm. The operators are applied systematically and in a specific order, considering the preconditions and effects of each action, to reach the desired state.
