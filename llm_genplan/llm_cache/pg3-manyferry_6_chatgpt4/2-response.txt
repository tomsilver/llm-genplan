The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

Identify the current location of the ferry, and the locations of each car in the initial state.

For each car that needs to be moved, perform the following steps:
a. Sail the ferry to the location of the car.
b. Board the car onto the ferry.
c. Sail the ferry to the desired destination location for the car.
d. Debark the car at the destination location.

This strategy ensures that each car is transported to its desired destination one at a time, and it guarantees that the ferry will always be empty when it arrives at a car's location. This sequential approach eliminates the need for searching through various combinations of actions, as it directly follows the required steps to achieve the goal.
