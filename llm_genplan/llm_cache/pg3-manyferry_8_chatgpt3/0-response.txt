The ferry domain is a planning problem where cars need to be transported across a river by a ferry. The domain consists of predicates that describe the state of the problem such as car, location, at-ferry, empty-ferry, and on. The actions in this domain are sail, board, and debark. Sail moves the ferry from one location to another, board loads a car onto the ferry, and debark unloads a car from the ferry. The goal of the problem is to move the cars from their starting locations to their desired destinations, with the constraint that only cars that are on the ferry can be transported at any given time.
