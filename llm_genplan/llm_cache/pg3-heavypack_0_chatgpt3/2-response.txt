Yes, there is a simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search, and it is commonly known as the "stacking strategy". This strategy involves sorting the items in descending order of their weights, and then packing each item into the box in that order. 

To implement the stacking strategy, we start with an empty box and place the heaviest item at the bottom of the box. Then we stack the remaining items on top of the bottom item in decreasing order of their weights, provided that each item is lighter than the item below it and nothing is already on top of it. 

The stacking strategy is guaranteed to work for any problem instance in this domain, provided that the initial state satisfies the preconditions for the actions. This is because the domain and problem constraints ensure that all items can be stacked in the desired order and without violating any constraints. 

Therefore, the stacking strategy can be considered a simple and efficient solution to this domain, as it eliminates the need for search and relies only on a simple heuristic based on the weights of the items.
