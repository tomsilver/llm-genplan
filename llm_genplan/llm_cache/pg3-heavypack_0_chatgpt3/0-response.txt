The heavy-pack domain is a planning problem in which items of different weights and sizes must be packed into a box while satisfying certain constraints. The domain defines predicates for items being packed or unpacked, nothing being above an item, and one item being heavier than another. The actions in the domain include packing the first item into the empty box and stacking one packed item on top of another, provided that the top item is unpacked, heavier than the bottom item, and nothing is already on top of it. The goal of the problem is to pack all the items into the box, with none of them being unpacked and all of them having nothing above them. Two example problems are provided, each with a different set of objects and initial conditions.
