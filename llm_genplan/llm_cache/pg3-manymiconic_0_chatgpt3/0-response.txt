The Miconic domain involves a passenger elevator system in a building with multiple floors. The elevator can move up or down between floors and passengers can board and depart at different floors. The domain includes predicates to represent the current location of the elevator, the origin and destination floors of each passenger, whether a passenger has boarded or been served, and the relative position of floors. The domain also includes actions to represent boarding and departing passengers and moving the elevator between floors. The problem instances specify the initial state of the system, including the location and destination of each passenger and the location of the elevator, as well as the desired goal state of all passengers having been served.
