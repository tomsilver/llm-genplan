The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 139
    The code is trying to unpack a tuple of 2 values, but it's expecting 3. To fix the issue, we can modify the tuple to have three elements instead of two. In particular, we can change the predicate definitions to include the floor as a third argument:
                                                            ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 139)

Fix the code.
