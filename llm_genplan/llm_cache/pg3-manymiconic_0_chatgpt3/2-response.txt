The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to implement a rule-based controller that uses a fixed set of rules to determine the actions to take based on the current state of the system. This controller can be designed using a simple if-then-else structure or a decision tree to encode the rules. The rules would specify the conditions under which the elevator should move up or down, open or close its doors, and allow passengers to board or depart. For example, if a passenger is waiting at a floor and the elevator is at that floor, the elevator should open its doors and allow the passenger to board. Similarly, if a passenger has arrived at their destination floor and the elevator is at that floor, the elevator should open its doors and allow the passenger to depart. The controller would repeat this process until all passengers have been served and the goal state is achieved. This strategy is called a rule-based system and can be an effective method for solving problems in domains with a small number of states and actions.
