The code is trying to unpack a tuple of 2 values, but it's expecting 3. To fix the issue, we can modify the tuple to have three elements instead of two. In particular, we can change the predicate definitions to include the floor as a third argument:

```
(:predicates
  (origin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor)
  (destin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor)
  (above ?floor1 - floor ?floor2 - floor)
  (boarded ?person - passenger)
  (served ?person - passenger)
  (lift-at ?floor - floor)
)
```

Then we need to update the `get_plan` function to unpack the new format of the predicates. Specifically, we need to change the lines that extract the floor in the following code block:

```
waiting_passengers = [p for (p, _, f) in init if p.startswith('origin') and f == elevator_location]
current_destinations = [d for (d, _, f) in init if d.startswith('destin') and f == elevator_location]
```

We need to replace `_` with a variable that stores the floor argument:

```
waiting_passengers = [p for (p, _, f) in init if p.startswith('origin') and f == elevator_location]
current_destinations = [d for (d, _, f) in init if d.startswith('destin') and f == elevator_location]
```

After this modification, the `get_plan` function should work correctly.
