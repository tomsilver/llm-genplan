The "Trap Newspapers" domain is a simple domain for planning problems involving delivering newspapers to different locations. The domain consists of locations and newspapers, where a location can be either a homebase or a delivery location. The predicates in the domain describe the state of a location, such as whether a location is the homebase, whether a location wants a newspaper, and whether a location has been satisfied by the delivery. Actions in the domain include picking up newspapers from the homebase, moving to a different location, and delivering newspapers to a location that wants them. The two example problems involve delivering newspapers to multiple locations, with different initial states and goals.
