The `IndexError` indicates that the line `homebase = [obj for obj in objects if obj[1] == "loc" and "ishomebase" in init and ("ishomebase", obj[0]) in init][0][0]` is trying to access the first element of an empty list, which means that no object of type `loc` with the `ishomebase` predicate is present in the initial state. This could happen if there is a typo in the initial state or if the problem definition is incorrect.

To fix the code, we can add a check to make sure that the list of homebase locations is not empty before accessing its first element. Here is an updated implementation:

```python
def get_plan(objects, init, goal):
    homebase_locs = [obj[0] for obj in objects if obj[1] == "loc" and ("ishomebase", obj[0]) in init]
    if not homebase_locs:
        raise ValueError("No homebase location found in initial state")
    homebase = homebase_locs[0]
    papers = [obj[0] for obj in objects if obj[1] == "paper"]
    locations = [obj[0] for obj in objects if obj[1] == "loc" and obj[0] != homebase]

    plan = []
    carrying = None
    satisfied = set()

    while len(satisfied) < len(locations):
        # Find the closest unsatisfied location
        distance, closest = min([(1 if loc in satisfied else 0, loc) for loc in locations])

        # If we are at the closest location, deliver the paper if carrying one
        if carrying and closest in init and ("wantspaper", closest) in init:
            plan.append(f"deliver {carrying} {closest}")
            carrying = None
            satisfied.add(closest)

        # Otherwise, go to the closest location and pick up a paper if not carrying one
        else:
            plan.append(f"move {homebase} {closest}")
            if carrying is None:
                carrying = papers.pop()
                plan.append(f"pick-up {carrying} {homebase}")

    return plan
```

The updated implementation first checks if the list of homebase locations is not empty, and raises a `ValueError` if it is. Otherwise, it proceeds with the same logic as before.
