The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to always pick up a newspaper and deliver it to the location that wants it until all locations are satisfied. This strategy can be implemented as a loop that repeatedly selects an unsatisfied location, picks up a newspaper at the homebase (if not already carrying one), moves to the selected location, and delivers the newspaper (if carrying one). The loop continues until all locations are satisfied. This strategy works because there is always a direct route from the homebase to any location that wants a newspaper, and there is no cost associated with moving between locations. Since the domain only involves one agent and there are no obstacles or constraints to worry about, this simple strategy can guarantee a solution for any problem in the domain without the need for search or complex planning.
