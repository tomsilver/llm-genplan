A simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is the "Sweep" strategy. In this approach, the elevator starts at the bottom floor and moves upward floor by floor, allowing passengers to board or depart the elevator as needed. Once the elevator reaches the top floor, it reverses direction and moves downward floor by floor, again allowing passengers to board or depart. This process is repeated until all passengers have reached their destination floors and are marked as served.

The Sweep strategy ensures that all passengers are served while minimizing the complexity of planning. However, it may not be the most efficient solution in terms of the number of actions or time taken, as the elevator will visit every floor on its way up and down, even if there are no passengers to pick up or drop off at certain floors.
