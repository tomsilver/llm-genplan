The Miconic domain represents a simplified elevator system. In this domain, there are two types of objects: passengers and floors. Passengers have an origin floor and a destination floor. The elevator can be at a specific floor, and it can move up or down between floors. There are four actions: board, depart, up, and down.

Board: A passenger boards the elevator when it is at their origin floor.
Depart: A passenger departs the elevator when it is at their destination floor.
Up: The elevator moves up from one floor to another, given that the latter is above the former.
Down: The elevator moves down from one floor to another, given that the latter is above the former.
The goal is to serve all passengers by taking them from their origin floors to their destination floors. The example problems provided have different floor configurations and passenger locations.
