The "spanner" domain involves a man named Bob who has to use a spanner to tighten nuts placed at different locations connected by links. The domain has four types of objects: locations, locatable objects, spanners, and nuts. The predicates used in this domain include "at" (an object is at a location), "carrying" (a man is carrying a spanner), "useable" (a spanner is useable), "link" (two locations are connected by a link), "tightened" (a nut is tightened), and "loose" (a nut is loose). The actions available to Bob include "walk" (to move from one location to another), "pickup_spanner" (to pick up a spanner at a location), and "tighten_nut" (to tighten a nut at a location using a spanner). There are two example problems defined in this domain, where Bob has to tighten three nuts placed at different locations while carrying a limited number of spanners.
