The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 17, in get_plan
    ball_room = next(atom[1] for atom in init if atom[0] == 'at' and atom[1] != goal_room and atom[2] == ball_name)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
StopIteration

Fix the code.
