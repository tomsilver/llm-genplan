The gripper-strips domain is a simple robotic manipulation domain where the task is to move balls from one room to another using grippers. The domain has predicates to describe rooms, balls, grippers, and their positions. There are three actions available: move, pick, and drop. The move action moves the robot to a different room, while the pick and drop actions are used to pick and drop balls using grippers. The goal of the problem is to move specific balls to specific rooms. The problems defined in this domain have different initial and goal states, with varying numbers of balls and grippers.
