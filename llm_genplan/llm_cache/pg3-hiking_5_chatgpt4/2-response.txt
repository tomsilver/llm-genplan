The given domain does not provide a simple strategy to solve all problems without using search, as the terrain and the location of hills, water, and trails vary in each problem. A search algorithm would be needed to explore different paths and decide which actions to take (walk or climb) to navigate through the terrain.

However, if the domain were to be significantly simplified, such as having a terrain with no water or hills and a fixed starting point, a simple strategy could be applied. In that case, one could just follow the adjacent locations in a specific direction until the goal is reached.
