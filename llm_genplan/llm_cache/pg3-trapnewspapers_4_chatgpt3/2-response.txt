The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to assign each location to a newspaper and then deliver that newspaper directly to the assigned location. In other words, for each location that wants a newspaper, find the closest unpacked newspaper and deliver it directly to that location. This strategy does not require search because it is a simple heuristic that avoids considering all possible plans and instead directly delivers newspapers to their assigned locations. If there are not enough unpacked newspapers to satisfy all the locations, then it is impossible to solve the problem. This strategy assumes that it is always safe to move between locations, which is indicated by the `safe` predicate in the domain definition.
