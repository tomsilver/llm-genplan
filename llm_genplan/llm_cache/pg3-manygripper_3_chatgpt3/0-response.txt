The Gripper-Strips domain involves a robot named Robby and grippers that can pick up and drop off balls in various rooms. The domain has predicates to represent the locations of Robby, balls, and grippers, as well as their respective states of carrying or being free. The actions available in the domain include moving Robby between rooms, picking up a ball with a free gripper and carrying it, and dropping off a ball in a room while freeing the gripper. The problem instances involve specifying the initial locations of Robby, balls, and grippers, as well as a goal configuration of balls in specific rooms that Robby needs to achieve by carrying out a sequence of actions.
