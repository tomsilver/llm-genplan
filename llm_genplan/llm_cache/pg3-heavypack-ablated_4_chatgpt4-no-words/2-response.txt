The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves applying the actions in a sequential manner.

1. Apply action operator0 to each object: This will negate predicate0 and make predicate4 and predicate2 true for the given object, while negating predicate6 for the same object. Since the precondition of operator0 is only predicate0 being true, this action can be applied to each object in any order.

2. Apply action operator1 to related pairs of objects: After executing operator0 for all objects, you can apply operator1 to each pair of objects (?v0, ?v4) where predicate1 is true for these objects and predicate6 is true for ?v4. Since operator0 negates predicate6 for each object it is applied to, you only need to apply operator1 once for each pair of objects. This action will make predicate4 and predicate2 true for ?v4, while negating predicate2 for ?v0 and predicate6 for ?v4.

Following these steps, the goal state of having predicate4 true for all objects (object0, object1, object2, and object3) will be achieved. This strategy works for all problems in this domain without the need for a search algorithm.
