The simple strategy for solving all problems in the "heavy-pack" domain without using search is to first sort the objects by their weight in decreasing order, i.e., from heaviest to lightest. Then, starting with the heaviest object, pack each object into the box as long as it satisfies the condition that nothing is placed on top of it. This strategy ensures that the heaviest object is always at the bottom and each object has nothing above it, which satisfies the preconditions of the "stack" action. Since the objects are sorted in decreasing order of weight, the heaviest object that can be packed will always be the one being considered, which means there is no need to consider other possible packing orders. If all the objects can be packed into the box, the goal is achieved. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. This strategy does not require any search or optimization, and it always leads to a valid solution if one exists.
