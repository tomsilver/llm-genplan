The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 32, in get_plan
    plan.append('(drop {} {} {})'.format(ball, goal[ball], gripper))
                                               ~~~~^^^^^^
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

Fix the code.
