The Gripper Strips domain involves a robot named Robby who can move around rooms and pick up balls using grippers. The domain includes predicates to represent the state of rooms, balls, grippers, and Robby's position. The domain has three actions: move, pick, and drop. The move action allows Robby to move from one room to another. The pick action allows Robby to pick up a ball from a room if he is in the same room as the ball and his gripper is free. The drop action allows Robby to drop a ball in a room if he is carrying the ball and he is in the same room as the gripper. The two example problems show different configurations of balls and rooms, with different goals for Robby to achieve by picking up and dropping balls in specific rooms.
