Given this task:

  (:goal (and
    (at ball1 room11)
    (at ball2 room7)
    )
  )    
)
        
The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(move room0 room3)', '(pick ball1 room3 gripper0)', '(drop ball1 room3 gripper0)'].
NOTE: The goal is not satisfied
(Follow each of:
    (Set (at ball1 room11) to true)
    and (Set (at ball2 room7) to true)
)
Fix the code.
