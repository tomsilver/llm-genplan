The heavy-pack domain is a simple logistics problem where objects of different weights need to be packed in a box, with the constraint that heavier objects can only be placed at the bottom of the box. The domain includes two actions: pack-first, which packs the first object into the empty box, and stack, which stacks an unpacked object on top of a packed object if the packed object is heavier. The goal is to pack all the objects into the box. The given example problems involve packing sets of objects into the box according to the rules of the domain.
