The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 18, in get_plan
    ball_room = next(a[1] for a in init if a[0] == 'at' and a[2] == ball)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
StopIteration

Fix the code.
