The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to assign each gripper to a specific ball and move it to its destination directly, without picking up any other balls along the way. This strategy can be implemented by first determining the gripper-ball assignments based on the initial state and goal state, and then executing the necessary sequence of pick and drop actions to move each ball to its destination. Since each gripper can only hold one ball at a time, this strategy ensures that the robot only carries one ball at a time and avoids unnecessary movements.
