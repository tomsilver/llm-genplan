The "gripper-strips" domain describes a world in which there are multiple rooms and balls located in these rooms. The task is for a robot called Robby, equipped with one or more grippers, to move around the rooms and pick up and drop off balls using the gripper(s). The grippers can hold one ball at a time, and Robby can only carry a ball if he has a gripper available. The goal is to move the balls to specific locations within the rooms.
