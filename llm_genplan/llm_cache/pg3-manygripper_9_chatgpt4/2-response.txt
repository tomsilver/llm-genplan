The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves the following steps:

Identify the goal state: Determine the desired locations for the balls mentioned in the goal state.
Move to the desired ball: For each ball that needs to be moved, start with the first one, and have Robby move to the room where that ball is located.
Pick up the ball: Use a free gripper to pick up the ball.
Move to the goal room: Move Robby to the room specified in the goal state for the ball being carried.
Drop the ball: Drop the ball in the goal room using the gripper carrying the ball.
Free the gripper: Mark the gripper as free after dropping the ball.
Repeat steps 2-6 for all the balls mentioned in the goal state.
This simple strategy ensures that Robby will move each ball to its desired location sequentially, without the need for an explicit search algorithm.
