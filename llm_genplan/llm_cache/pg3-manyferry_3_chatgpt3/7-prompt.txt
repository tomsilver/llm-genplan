The code raised the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 936, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1074, in get_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 1004, in source_to_code
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 241, in _call_with_frames_removed
  File "<file-name-omitted>", line 42
    The code has a missing opening parenthesis in the init section. It should be `(:init` instead of `:init`. Here's the corrected code:
                                                                                                                  ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 42)

Fix the code.
