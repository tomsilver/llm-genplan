The code failed. It returned the following plan: ['(board c2 at-ferry)', '(board c3 at-ferry)', '(board c4 at-ferry)', '(board c0 at-ferry)', '(board c1 at-ferry)', '(sail l0 l10)', '(debark c3 l0)', '(debark c2 l9)', '(debark c1 l1)', '(debark c0 l9)', '(debark c4 l7)'].
NOTE: (board c2 at-ferry) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 0
(Follow each of:
    (Set (location at-ferry) to true)
    and (Set (at c2 at-ferry) to true)
    and (Set (at-ferry at-ferry) to true)
)
Fix the code.
