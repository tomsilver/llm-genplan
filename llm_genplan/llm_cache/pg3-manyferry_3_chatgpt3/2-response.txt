The simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to first load all the cars that need to be transported onto the ferry and sail the ferry to the other side of the river. Then, all the cars are unloaded from the ferry at the new location. This process is repeated until all the cars have been transported to their final destinations.

This strategy works because the problem constraints ensure that it is always possible to load all the cars onto the ferry without exceeding its capacity, and that it is always possible to sail the ferry to the other side of the river if there are cars on board. Additionally, the "not-eq" predicate ensures that it is not possible to sail to an invalid location. Therefore, by repeating the process of loading, sailing, and unloading, the cars can be transported to their final destinations without the need for search.
