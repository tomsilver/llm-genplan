The ferry domain is a planning problem where cars must be transported across a river by a ferry. The domain consists of predicates for car and location positions, whether the ferry is empty, and whether the ferry is at a specific location. The actions available in the domain are "sail", which moves the ferry from one location to another, "board", which puts a car on the ferry, and "debark", which takes a car off the ferry. The goal is to move a set of cars to specific locations on the other side of the river, given their initial locations and the available actions.
