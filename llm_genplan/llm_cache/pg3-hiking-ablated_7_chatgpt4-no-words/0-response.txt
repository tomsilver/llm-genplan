This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain", involves a single type called "type0". There are five predicates in this domain: predicate0, predicate1, predicate3, predicate4, and predicate5. Each predicate takes either one or two variables of "type0" as arguments. There are two actions defined in the domain: "operator1" and "operator0", both of which have two parameters of "type0". The preconditions and effects of these actions involve various combinations of the predicates and their negations.

Two example problems are provided: "my-problem-3" and "my-problem-2". In both problems, there is a collection of objects of "type0". The initial state consists of a set of predicate0 connections between the objects, predicate1 applied to a specific object, predicate3 and predicate4 applied to some other objects, and predicate5 connecting specific pairs of objects. The goal in both problems is to have predicate1 applied to a particular object. The difference between the two problems is in the initial state and the goal object.
