The simple strategy for solving all problems in the Miconic domain without using search is to always move the elevator to the highest floor among the floors that have waiting passengers, and then stop at all floors on the way down to pick up passengers and drop them off at their respective destinations. This strategy is called the "highest floor strategy" and it exploits the fact that the elevator system in the Miconic domain is relatively simple and does not require sophisticated planning techniques. The highest floor strategy is guaranteed to find a solution to any problem in the Miconic domain, but it may not always find the optimal solution in terms of the number of actions or the time required to transport all passengers.
