It seems like the error message is not actually code, but rather an explanation of the error. It is likely that the original code had some issues that led to this error. Without seeing the original code, it is difficult to provide a specific fix. However, based on the error message, it seems like there may be a syntax error related to a string literal or a comment in the code. 

If you can provide the original code or more context about the error, I would be happy to help you fix the issue.
