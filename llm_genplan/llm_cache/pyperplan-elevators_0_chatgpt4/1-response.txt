A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search is to follow these steps:

    Move each elevator to the floor where a passenger is waiting.
    Board the passenger onto the elevator.
    Move the elevator to the desired floor for the passenger.
    Let the passenger leave the elevator.

Repeat these steps for each passenger in the problem. If there is more than one passenger on the same floor or if an elevator has enough capacity to hold multiple passengers, group these passengers and process them together.

This strategy assumes that the capacity constraints of the elevators are not limiting, and that the elevators can reach all floors where passengers are located. Since the domain does not specify any time or movement constraints, this simple strategy will result in a solution without requiring search. However, the solution may not be optimal in terms of the number of actions or time taken.
