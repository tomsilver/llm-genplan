A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search involves executing the actions in a specific order, as follows:

1. Apply the 'operator1' action on each type0 object that has predicate6 and predicate0 true, using another type0 object as the second parameter. This will make the second type0 object satisfy predicate0. Choose the second type0 object that is not a part of the goal.

2. Apply the 'operator2' action on each pair of type0 and type1 objects such that the type0 object has predicate0 and predicate3 true, and the type1 object has predicate8 true. This will make the type1 object satisfy predicate1.

3. Finally, apply the 'operator0' action on each pair of type0 and type1 objects such that the type0 object has predicate0 and predicate9 true, and the type1 object has predicate1 true. This will make the type0 object satisfy predicate7 and remove predicate9 from the type0 object.

By following this strategy, you will achieve the goal state where the specified type0 objects satisfy predicate7.
