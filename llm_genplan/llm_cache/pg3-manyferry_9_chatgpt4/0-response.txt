The ferry domain involves ferrying cars between different locations using a single ferry. There are three main actions: sail, board, and debark. The "sail" action moves the ferry from one location to another, ensuring the two locations are different. The "board" action allows a car to board the ferry at a location if the ferry is present and empty. The "debark" action allows a car to disembark the ferry at a location if the car is on the ferry and the ferry is present at that location. The goal is to move the cars to their desired locations using the ferry. The example problems provided involve initial and goal states for the cars and ferry at different locations.
