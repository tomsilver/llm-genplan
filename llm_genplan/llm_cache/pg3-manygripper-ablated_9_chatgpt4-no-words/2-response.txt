A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search would be to systematically apply the action operators in a specific order to achieve the goal conditions. To derive the strategy, we need to understand the purpose of each operator and how they interact with the predicates.

1. operator1: Moves the `predicate1` property from one object to another.
2. operator2: Removes the `predicate0` and `predicate5` properties, and assigns the `predicate3` property.
3. operator0: Removes the `predicate3` property, assigns the `predicate0` and `predicate5` properties.

To achieve the goals in this domain, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects that need to have `predicate0` in the goal state.
2. For each of these objects, find an object that needs to be paired with it according to the goal.
3. If the object is already in the desired `predicate0` relationship, no further action is needed.
4. If not, first use `operator1` to move the `predicate1` property to an object that is not part of any `predicate0` relationship and will not be part of any `predicate0` relationship in the goal state.
5. Next, use `operator2` to break the current `predicate0` relationship for the objects that need to be paired differently.
6. Finally, use `operator0` to establish the desired `predicate0` relationship between the identified objects.

By following these steps, you can systematically modify the initial state to reach the goal state without the need for a search algorithm.
