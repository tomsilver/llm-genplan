The Gripper-Strips domain involves a robot named Robby who can move between different rooms and has two grippers to pick up and carry up to two balls at a time. The domain includes predicates for rooms, balls, grippers, and their locations, as well as actions for moving, picking up balls, and dropping balls. The goal of the domain is to move the balls to specific locations within the rooms using Robby and the grippers. Two example problems are provided, each with different initial ball and room configurations, but with the same goal of moving specific balls to specific rooms.
