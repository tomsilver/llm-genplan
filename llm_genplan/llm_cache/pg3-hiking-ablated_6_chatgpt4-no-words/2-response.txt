In this domain, the primary goal is to achieve a specific state for one of the objects using predicate1. To solve all problems without using search, you can follow this strategy:

1. Identify the target object from the goal state, which should have predicate1 applied to it.
2. Check the initial conditions to find the object that has predicate1 already applied.
3. Identify the connection between the target object and the object with predicate1 using predicate0.
4. Follow the connection established by predicate0 and apply the suitable action (operator1 or operator0) based on the presence or absence of predicate3 and predicate4 in the preconditions.
5. Keep applying the chosen action until the target object has predicate1 applied to it.

This simple strategy allows you to solve all problems in this domain without the need for extensive search.
