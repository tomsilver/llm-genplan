This PDDL domain, named "my-pddl-domain," contains one type (type0) and five predicates: predicate0, predicate1, predicate2, predicate3, and predicate4. There are two actions defined in the domain: operator1 and operator0. Both actions take two parameters of type0 and have similar preconditions, where the major differences are the presence or absence of predicate3 and predicate4. The effects of both actions involve updating the values of predicate1.

There are two example problems provided: my-problem-3 and my-problem-2. Both problems consist of objects of type0 and contain initial conditions for the predicates. The initial conditions describe the relationships between the objects and their respective states. The goal for each problem is to achieve a specific state for one of the objects, as described by predicate1.
