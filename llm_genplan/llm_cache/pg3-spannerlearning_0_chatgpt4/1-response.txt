A simple strategy for solving all problems in this domain without using search can be as follows:

    Identify the initial location of the man and the locations of the spanners and nuts.
    Determine the shortest path to traverse all locations with spanners and nuts.
    Follow the path, visiting each location sequentially:
    a. If there is a spanner at the current location, pick it up.
    b. If there is a nut at the current location and the man is carrying a useable spanner, tighten the nut with the spanner.
    Continue traversing the path until all locations with spanners and nuts have been visited and all nuts have been tightened.

This strategy assumes that the man can carry multiple spanners and that there are enough useable spanners to tighten all the nuts. It also assumes that the locations are connected in such a way that allows the man to visit all of them.
