The gripper-strips domain consists of a robot with grippers, balls, and rooms. The robot can move between rooms, pick up balls using its grippers, and drop the balls in different rooms. The domain is defined with three main actions: move, pick, and drop. The move action allows the robot to move from one room to another. The pick action enables the robot to pick up a ball in a room using a free gripper. The drop action allows the robot to drop a carried ball in a room, freeing the gripper.

The example problems provided involve moving the robot to specific rooms to pick up balls and drop them in other rooms to achieve the desired goal. These problems have different initial configurations of ball and room locations, and the goal states involve placing specific balls in designated rooms.
