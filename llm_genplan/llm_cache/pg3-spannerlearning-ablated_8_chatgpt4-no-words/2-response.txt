The strategy for solving problems in this domain without using search is to perform a sequence of actions that will lead to the desired goal state. Based on the given predicates and actions, the following steps can be taken:

1. First, identify the objects of type4 that need to have predicate6 in the goal state. These objects initially have predicate3.

2. Then, find an object of type3 (predicate0) that is connected to an object of type2, which is also connected to an object of type6 (predicate7).

3. Execute the `operator1` action with the selected objects of type2, type3, type4, and type6 as parameters. This action will remove predicate7 from the type6 object and predicate3 from the type4 object, and add predicate6 to the type4 object.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all objects of type4 that need to satisfy predicate6 in the goal state.

By following this sequence of actions, we can achieve the goal state without the need for search. The key is to find suitable objects for each action based on their predicates, and then apply the actions accordingly to reach the desired goal state.
